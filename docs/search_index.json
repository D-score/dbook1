["sec-first1000.html", "1.1 First 1000 days", " 1.1 First 1000 days The first 1000 days refers to time needed for a child to grow from conception to the second birthday. It is a time of rapid change. During this period the architecture of the developing brain is very open to the influence of relationships and experiences (Shonkhoff et al. 2016). Early experiences affect the nature and quality of the brain’s developing architecture by determining which synapses are reinforced, and which are pruned through lack of use. During the first 1000 days, brain architecture is basically shaped, but higher-order brain functions still continue to develop into adolescence and early adulthood (Kolb, Harker, and Gibb 2017). Figure 1.1: Serve and return interactions shape brain architecture. Source: Shonkhoff et al. (2016). The classic nature versus nurture debate contrasts the viewpoints that variation in development is primarily due to either genetic or environmental differences. The current scientific consensus is that virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental differences (Rutter 2007). The environment in which a child develops (before and soon after birth) provides experiences that can modify gene activity (Caspi et al. 2010). Negative influences, such as exposure to stressful life circumstances or environmental toxins, may leave a chemical signature on the genes, thereby influencing how genes work in that individual. During the first 1000 days, infants are highly dependent on their caregivers to protect them from adversities and to help them regulate their physiology and behavior. Caregivers can do this through responsive care, including routines for sleeping and feeding. To reach their developmental potential, children require nutrition, responsive care-giving, opportunities to explore and learn, and protection from environmental threats (Black et al. 2017). Gradually, children build self-regulatory skills that enable them to manage stress as they interact with the world around them (Johnson et al. 2013). References "],
["sec-relevance.html", "1.2 Relevance of child development", " 1.2 Relevance of child development The first 1000 days is a time of rapid change. Early experiences affect brain development and influence lifelong learning and health (Shonkhoff et al. 2016). Healthy development is associated with future school achievement, well-being and success in life (Bellman, Byrne, and Sege 2013). Professionals and parents consider it important to monitor children’s development. Tracking child development enables professionals to identify children with signs of potential delay. Timely identification can help children and their parents to benefit from early intervention. In a normal population, developmental delay affects about 1–3% of children. A delay in development may indicate underlying disorders. About 1% of children have an autism spectrum disorder (Baird et al. 2006), 1–2% a mild learning disability, and 5–10% have a specific learning disability in a single domain (Horridge 2011). Children develop at different rates, and it is important to distinguish those who are within the “normal” range from those who are following a more pathological course (Bellman, Byrne, and Sege 2013). There is good evidence that early identification and early intervention improve the outcomes of children (Britto et al. 2017). Early intervention is crucial for children with developmental disabilities because barriers to healthy development early in life impede development at each subsequent stages. Monitoring child development provides caregivers and parents with reliable information about the child, and a opportunity to intervene at an early age. Understanding the developmental health of populations of children allows organisations and policymakers to make informed decisions about programmes that support children’s greatest needs (Bellman, Byrne, and Sege 2013).

["sec-stunting.html", "1.3 Stunting as proxy for child development", " 1.3 Stunting as proxy for child development Stunting is the impaired physical growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Linear growth in children is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age in comparison to normative growth standards (Wit et al. 2017). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the Child Growth Standards median. Stunting caused by chronic nutritional deprivation in early childhood can be considered as an indicator of (poor) child development (Perkins et al. 2017). Figure 1.2: Seven eight-year old children standing in front of a wall with the line depicting the average height according to the WHO Child Growth Standards. There is consistent evidence for an association between stunting and poor child development, despite heterogeneity in the estimation of its magnitude (Miller et al. 2016; Sudfeld et al. 2015). Considering impaired linear growth as a proxy measure for child development is easy to do, and in fact quite common. Yet, using impaired height growth as measure for child development is not without limitations: The relation between height and child development is weak after adjustment for age; Height is a physical indicator that does not take into account a direct evaluation of a child’s cognitive or mental performance; There is considerable heterogeneity in heights of children all over the world; Height is not sensitive to rapid changes in child development.

["sec-neurocognitive.html", "1.4 Measuring neurocognitive development", " 1.4 Measuring neurocognitive development Assessment of early neurocognitive development in children is challenging for many reasons (Ellingsen 2016). During the first years of life developmental change occurs rapidly, and the manifestation of different skills and abilities varies considerably across children. Moreover, a child’s performance on a cognitive task is very susceptible to measurement setting, timing and the health of the child that day. Recently, a toolkit was published that reviews 147 assessment tools developed for children ages 0–8 years in low- and middle-income countries (Fernald et al. 2017). Some of the most widely used tools include the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), Denver Developmental Screening Test (DEN), Griffiths Scales of Child Development (GRF), Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and its younger age counterpart Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). Each of these tools has its strengths and limitations. For example, the ASQ and DEN are screeners for general child development. The CBCL and SDQ are screeners for behavioral and mental health, not cognition or general development. DEN is relatively easy and quick to administer, but not very precise. It is out of production, not being sold or re-normed. The BSID, MSEL and GRF provide a clinical assessment at the individual level, and requires a skilled professional to administer. Some instruments collect observations through the caregiver (ASQ), whereas others emphasize traits and behavior over performance (SDQ, CBCL). Moreover, the age ranges to which the instruments are sensitive vary, as well as the representation of different domains of development. The ideal child development assessment would be easy to administer and has high reliability, validity, and cross-cultural appropriateness. It should also show appropriate sensitivity in scores at different ages and ability levels. It is no surprise that no test can meet all of these criteria. Many tests are too long, difficult to administer, lack cross-cultural validity or have low reliability. In addition, many instruments are proprietary and costly to use. References "],
["sec-why.html", "1.5 Why this booklet?", " 1.5 Why this booklet? We believe that there cannot be one instrument for measuring child development that is suitable for all situations. In general, the instrument needs to be tailored to the setting. For example, in order to establish whether an individual child is delayed in development, we need an instrument that is precise for that individual child, and that is sensitive to different domains of delay. In contrast, if we want to estimate the proportion of children that is developmentally on track in a country, we need one culturally unbiased, relatively imprecise low-cost measurement made on many children across many ages, which we then aggregate over all children in the sample. The optimal instrument for each setting will look quite different. We also believe that there can be one scale for measuring child development, and that this scale is useful for many applications. Such a scale is similar to well-known scales for body height, body weight or body temperature. These scales have a clearly defined unit (i.e., centimeter, kilogram, degree Celcius), which moreover is assumed to be constant across all scale locations. Measurements are expressed as the number of scale units (e.g. 92 cm). Note that there may be multiple instruments for measuring a child height (e.g. ruler, laser distance meter, echo location, ability to reach the door handle, and so on), but their result can all be expressed as the number of scale units (cm here). The opposite is also true, and perhaps more familiar. We may have one instrument and express the result in multiple units (e.g. cm, inches, light years). Instruments and scales are different things. Currently, instruments for measuring child development define their own scales, which renders the measurements made by different instrument incomparable. No measurement unit for child development yet exists. It would certainly be an advance if we could tailor the measurement instrument to the setting, while retaining the advantage of a scale with a clearly defined unit across different instruments. We can then compare the data collected by different instruments. This booklet explores the theory and practice for making that happen. "],
["sec-audience.html", "1.6 Intended audience", " 1.6 Intended audience We aim for three broad audiences: Professionals in the field of child growth and development; Policy makers in international settings; Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists. Professionals in child development will become familiar with a new approach to measuring child development in early childhood. Our plan is to separate the measurement instrument from the scale used to express the result. This formulation allows the user to select the instrument most suited for a particular setting. Since instruments differ widely in age coverage, length, administration mode, domain coverage, and so on (Boggs et al. 2019), the ability to choose the instrument, while not giving up comparability, represents a major advance over routines that marry the scale to the instrument. Policy makers in international settings wish to know the effect of different interventions on child development. Insight into such effects is hampered by the fact that different studies use different instruments. The ability to place measurements made by different instruments onto the same scale will allow for a more accurate understanding of policy effects. It also enables setting of priorities and action levels that are less dependent on the way the data were collected. Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists generally prefer numeric values with an unambiguous unit (e.g. centimeters, kilograms) over a vector of dichotomous data points. This booklet shows how to convert a series of PASS/FAIL scores to a numeric value with interval scale properties. This opens the way for the application of precise analytic techniques, similar to those applied to child height and body weight. The techniques have a solid psychometric backing, and also apply to other types of problems. References "],

["sec-definitions.html", "2.1 What is child development?", " 2.1 What is child development? In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what exactly constitutes child development. One of the first rigorous studies in the field (Shirley 1931) was executed under the explicit aim … that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously. Shirley gave empirical definitions of each of these domains of development. Figure 2.1: Gross motor development as a sequence of milestones. Source: Shirley (1933). Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure 2.1 illustrates the various stages needed for going from a fetal posture to walking alone. The ages are indicative of when these events happen, but there is a large variation in timing between infants. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development: Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in an orderly sequence. Gesell’s definition emphasizes that development is a continuous process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves. Liebert, Poulos, and Strauss (1974) (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon that unfolds in isolation. Development refers to a process in growth and capability over time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with the environment. Cameron and Bogin (2012) (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows: “Growth” is defined as an increase in size, while “maturity” or “development” is an increase in functional ability…The endpoint of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate successfully … not just biological maturity but also behavioral and perhaps social maturity. Berk (2011) (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on child development as follows: Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions, each representing a different skill area that may undergo both continuous and stagewise transformation. There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given here just illustrate the main points of view in the field. References "],
["sec-theories.html", "2.2 Theories of child development", " 2.2 Theories of child development The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g. Santrock (2011), Berk (2011)), or by searching for the topic of interest in an encyclopedia (e.g. Salkind (2002)). The introductions by Santrock (2011) and Berk (2011) both distinguish major theories in child development according to how each answers to following three questions: 2.2.1 Continuous or discontinuous? Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring from one stage to another? Many stage-based theories of human development have been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by psycho-sexual stages proposed by Freud and furthered by Erikson (Erikson 1963), Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (Kohlberg 1984) and Piaget’s cognitive development theory (Piaget and Inhelder 1969). Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout childhood. The first period, the sensimotor period (approximately 0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these six stages describe “the road to conceptual thought”. Piaget’s stages are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism involved in intellectual development. On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a continuous process. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) says: A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on. 2.2.2 One course or multiple parallel tracks? Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the work of Gesell. The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion, so there may be multiple, parallel ways to reach the same point. Figure 2.2 illustrates that the path taken by a given child will depend on the child’s unique combination of personal and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in development. Figure 2.2: A representation of the dynamic systems viewpoint on how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point using different paths. Source: Berk (2011). 2.2.3 Nature or nurture? Are genetic or environmental factors more important for influencing development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question how to explain individual differences. Maturation is the process of becoming completely developed, much like the natural unfolding of a flower. The process depends on both genetic factors (species, breed) as well as environmental influences (sunlight, water, nutrition). Some theorists emphasize that differences in child development are innate and stable over time, although there may be differences in unfolding speed due to different environments. Others argue that differences in development between children are primarily driven by environmental factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child development. Our position in this debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that differences are natural and stable, then it may not make much sense trying to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to be small. On the other hand, if we think of developmental potential as evenly distributed, with its expression governed by the environment, then improving life circumstances may have substantial pay-offs in terms of better development.

["sec-motorexample.html", "2.3 Example of motor development", " 2.3 Example of motor development 2.3.1 Shirley’s motor data For illustration, we use data on loco-motor development collected in the classic study on child development among 25 babies by Shirley (1931). Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of the baby’s walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room, and lightly greases the soles of the baby’s feet with olive oil. The baby was invited to “walk” on the sheet. Of course, very young infants need substantial assistance. Footprints left were later colored by graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were repeated every week or bi-weekly. Table 2.1: Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) for 21 babies.

Table 2.1 from (Shirley 1931, Appendix 8) lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark in the first column occurs when the baby was already stepping when the observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris has a question mark in the last column, because she passed away before she could walk alone. 2.3.2 Individual trajectories of motor development Figure 2.3: Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby achieves a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Figure 2.3 is a visual representation of the information in Table 2.1. Each data point is the age of first occurrence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs, there is a jump to the next level. The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry) or who jump over stages (Martin, Max). For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no sensible interpretation. We might be inclined to think that the vertical distance portrays to how difficult it is to achieve the next stage, but this is inaccurate. Instead, difficulty of passing from one stage to the next corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction between stages. For example, on average the line for stepping is rather short in all plots, so going from stepping to standing is relatively easy. The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher. Shirley (1931) actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure 2.3 plot only the 76 visits that showed a jump. In order to obtain individual curves like these, the data collection needs to be intense and costly. Fortunately, there are alternatives that are much more efficient. References "],

["sec-agebased.html", "3.1 Age-based measurement of development", " 3.1 Age-based measurement of development 3.1.1 Motivation for age-based measurement Milestones form the based building blocks for instruments to measure child development. Methods to quantify development using separate milestones typically relate the milestone behavior to the child’s age. Gesell (1943) (p. 89) formulated this goal as follows: We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age. There is a large literature that quantifies development in terms of the ages at which the child is expected to show a specific behavior. The oldest methods for quantifying child development calculate an age equivalent for achieving a milestone, and compare the child’s age to this age equivalent. 3.1.2 Age equivalent and developmental age Figure 3.1: (ref:agebased) Figure 3.1 graphs the ages at which each of the 21 children enters a given stage in Shirley’s motor data of Table 2.1. Since stepping is followed by standing children who can stand are older than the children who are stepping, and hence more the ages for standing are plotted more to the right. Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of a given developmental milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of the mean age at which children achieve it. For example, Stott (1967) (p. 25) defines the age equivalent and its use for measurement, as follows: The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age at which children reach that particular stage. Figure 3.2: Mean (symbol x) and spread of the ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. Figure 3.2 adds the mean age and the boxplot at which the children enter the four stages. The difficulty of the stages can thus be expressed as age equivalents: 16.1 weeks for stepping, 27.2 weeks for standing, 43.3 weeks for walking with help and 63.3 weeks for walking alone. Thus, a child that is stepping beyond the age of 16.1 weeks is considered later than average, whereas a child already stepping before 27.2 weeks is considered earlier than average. We may also calculate age delta as the difference between the child’s age and the norm age, and express it as “two weeks late” or “three weeks ahead”. Summarizing age delta’s over different milestones has led to concepts like developmental age as a measure of a child’s development. 3.1.3 Limitations of age-based measurement Age-based measurement is easy to understand, and widely used in the popular press, but not without pitfalls: Age-based measurement requires us to know the ages at which the child entered a new stage. The mean age can be a biased estimate of item difficulty if visits are widely apart, irregular or missing. Age-based measurement can inform us whether a child is achieving a given milestone early of late. However, it does not tell is what behaviors are characteristic for children of a given age. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there are no norms, we cannot quantify development. Age-based measurement works only at the milestone level. Although we may average age delta’s over milestones, the selection of milestones is arbitrary. References "],
["sec-probbased.html", "3.2 Probability-based measurement", " 3.2 Probability-based measurement An alternative is to calculate the probability of achieving a milestone given the child’s age, and compare the child’s response to that probability. The passing probability is an easy to interpret and relevant measure. An operational advantage of the approach is that the necessary calculations places less demands on the available data, and can be done even for cross-sectional studies. 3.2.1 Example of probability-based measurement Figure 3.3: Probability of achieving four motor milestones against age. Figure 3.3 plots the percentage of children passing each of Shirley’s motor milestones against age. There are four cumulative curves, one of each milestone, that indicate the number of children that pass the milestone. In analogy to the age equivalent introduced in Section 3.1.2 we can define the difficulty of the milestone as the age at which 50 percent of the children pass. In the Figure we see that the difficulties are approximately 14.2 weeks (stepping), 27.0 weeks (standing), 43.8 weeks (walking with help) and 64.0 weeks (walking alone). In addition, we may easily find the ages at which 10 percent or 90 percent of the children pass each milestone. Observe there is a gradual decline in the steepness as we move from stepping to walk_alone. For example, we need an age interval of 13 weeks (33 - 20) to go from 10 to 90 percent in standing, but need 19 weeks (71 - 52) to go from 10 to 90 percent in walking alone. Thus, one step on the age axis corresponds to different steps in probability. The flattening pattern is typical for child development, and represents clear evidence that development is faster at earlier ages. 3.2.2 Limitations of probability-based measurement Probability-based measurement is a popular way to create instruments for screening on developmental delay. For example, each milestone in the Denver II (Frankenburg et al. 1992) has markers for the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th age percentile. The same age step corresponds to different probabilities. The measurement cannot exists without a norm population. When norms differ, we cannot compare the measurements. Interpretation is typically done at the milestone level, sometimes supplemented by procedures for counting the number of delays. There is no aggregate that takes all responses into account.

["sec-scorebased.html", "3.3 Score-based measurement of development", " 3.3 Score-based measurement of development 3.3.1 Motivation for score-based measurement Score-based measurement takes the responses on multiple milestones and counts the total number of passed milestones as a measure of child’s development. This approach takes multiple measurements into account, hence leading to a more stable measurement. One may order milestones in difficulty, and skip milestones that are too easy, and stop administration when milestones become too difficult. In such cases we cannot simply interpret the sum score of a measure of development, and need to correct for the subset of milestones that was actually administered. The usual working assumption is that the child would have passed all easier milestones and failed on all more difficult milestones. This procedure is typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor, cognitive, and so on. 3.3.2 Example of score-based measurement Figure 3.4 is a gross-motor score calculated as the number of milestones passed. It varies from 0 to 3. Figure 3.4: Same data as in Figure 2.3, but now with the vertical axis representing gross-motor score. The plot suggests that the difference in development between scores 0 and 1 is the same as the difference in development between, say, scores 2 and 3. This is not true. For example, suppose that we express difficulty of the milestone as an age-equivalent. From section 3.1.2 we see that the difference in difficulty between stepping and standing is 27.2 - 16.1 = 11.1 weeks, whereas the difference between walking alone and walking with help is 63.3 - 43.3 = 20 weeks. Thus, according to age equivalents scores 0 and 1 should be closer to each other, and scores 2 and 3 should be drawn wider apart. 3.3.3 Limitations of score-based measurement Score-based measurement is today’s dominant approach, but is not without conceptual and logistical issues. The total score depends not only on the (true) developmental status of the child, but also on the set of milestones actually administered. If a milestone is skipped or added, the sum score cannot be interpreted anymore as a measure of the child’s developmental status. It might be possible to correct for starting and stopping rules under the assumptions described in Section @(sec:motivscorebased), but such will be complicated if intermediate milestones are missing. It is not possible to compare scores made by different instruments. Some instruments allow conversion to age-conditional scores. However, the sample used to derive such conversions are typically restricted to one instrument, and does not extend to measurements made by other instruments. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive milestones tap into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The materials are often proprietary and costly. "],
["sec-unitbased.html", "3.4 Unit-based measurement of development", " 3.4 Unit-based measurement of development 3.4.1 Motivation for unit-based measurement Unit-based measurement starts by defining the ideal properties of the measurement, and derives a procedure to aggregate the responses on milestones into an overall score that will meet the ideal. Section 2.4 highlighted questions for individuals, groups and populations. There are basically three questions: What is the difference in development over time for the same child, group or population? What is the difference in development between different children, groups or populations of the same age? How does child development compare to a norm? In the ideal situation, we would like to have a continuous (latent) variable \\(D\\) (for development) that measures child development. The scale should allow us to quantify ability of persons, groups or populations from low to high. The scale should have a constant unit, so that a given difference in ability refers to the same quantity across the entire scale, just like that a difference of 10 cm is the same irrespective of whether we compare the heights of books or the heights of houses. When are these conditions are met, we say that we measure on an interval scale. If we succeed in creating an interval scale for child development, an enormous arsenal of techniques developed for quantitative variables opens up to measure, track and analyze child development. We may then evaluate the development of a child in terms of \\(D\\) points gained, create age-dependent charts for development (just like growth charts for height and weight), devise age-conditional measures for child development, and intelligent adaptive testing schemes. Promising studies on Dutch data (Jacobusse, van Buuren, and Verkerk 2006, @jacobusse2007, @vanbuuren2014) suggest that such benefits are well within reach. 3.4.2 Example of unit-based measurement Figure 3.5: Modeled probability of achieving four motor milestones against the \\(D\\)-score. Figure 3.5 is similar to Figure 3.3, but with Age replaced by Ability. Also, the empirical curves have been replaced by modeled curves, but this is not essential. The ability values on the horizontal axis are estimated from the data and correspond to the amount of development of each measurement. Also, the logistic curves are estimated from the data, and reflect the probability of passing each milestone at a given level of ability. The figure shows that the probability of passing a milestone increases with ability. Milestones are ordered in difficulty from left to right. Milestone stepping is the easiest and walk_alone is most difficult. The point at which a logistic curve crosses the 50 percent line (marked by a cross) is customarily taken as the difficulty of the milestone. The increase in ability that is needed to go from 10 to 90 percent is about five units here. Since all curves are parallel, the interval is constant for all scale locations. Thus, the scale is an interval scale with a constant unit of measurement. This is the type of measurement scale needed for answering the basic questions identified in Section 3.4.1. 3.4.3 Limitations of unit-based measurement While unit-based measurement has many advantages, it cannot perform miracles. An important assumption is that the milestones “measure the same thing”, or put differently, are manifestations of an underlying continuous latent variable that can be measured by empirical observations. Unit-based measurement won’t work if there is no sensible latent scale. The portrayed advantages hold only if the discrepancies between the data and the model are relatively small. Since the simplest and most powerful measurement models are very strict, it is important to assess and increase the fit between data and model, for example by removing milestones that do not measure the underlying trait. The construction of unit-based measurement requires psychometric expertise, specialized computer software and considerable sample sizes. References "],
["sec-whatismeasurement.html", "3.5 A unified framework", " 3.5 A unified framework This section brings together the four approaches outlined in this chapter into a unified framework. Figure 3.6: Placing milestones and children onto the same line reveals their positions. Figure 3.6 shows the imaginary positions on a gross-motor continuum of three babies from Figure 2.1 at the age of 30 weeks. Both milestones and children are ordered along the same continuum. Thus, standing is more difficult than stepping, and at week 30, Doris is ahead of Walley in terms of motor development. More generally, measurement is the process of locating milestones and children on a line. This line represents a latent variable, a continuous construct that defines the different poles of the concept that we want to measure. A latent variable ranges from low to high. The first part of measurement is to determine where the milestones are located on the latent variable. In many cases, this part has already been done for us. For example, each length marker on a ruler corresponds to a milestone for measuring length. The manufacturer of the ruler has already placed the marks at the appropriate places on the ruler, and we take for granted that each marker has been calibrated correctly. A milestone for child development is similar to a length marker, but we often do not know how much development the milestone measures, so its location on the line is unknown, or uncertain; we often do not know whether the milestone measures child development at all, so it may have no location on the line. The second part of measurement is to find the location of each child on the line. For height this is easy. We place the horizontal head piece on top of the child’s head, and read off the closest height marker. Since we lack physical ruler for development, we must deduce the child’s location on the line from the responses on a series of well-chosen milestones. By definition, a latent variable cannot be measured directly. However, we may be able to actually measure variables (milestones) that are related to the latent variable. For example, we may have the child’s scores on tasks like standing or walking with help. The measurement model specifies the relations between the actual measurements and the latent variable. Under a given measurement model, we may estimate the locations of milestones and children on the line. Section 4.5 discusses measurement models in more detail. "],

Table 3.1 summarizes how the approaches evaluate on nine criteria. Age-based measurement expresses development in age equivalents, whose precise definition depends on the reference population. Age-based measurement does not support multiple milestones, and does not use the concept of a latent variable. Probability-based measurement expresses development as age percentiles with respect to a reference population. This type of measurement is useful for individual milestones, but does not support multiple milestones or a latent variable interpretation. Score-based measurement quantifies development by summing the number of passes. Different instruments make different selections of milestones, so the measurements taken are unique to the instruments, so comparing the measurement obtained by different instruments is difficult. Corrections are needed if milestones are skipped or added. Unit-based measurement defines a unit of measurement by a theoretical model. When the data fit the model, we are able to construct instruments that produce measurement in a common metric. "],

["sec-ddi.html", "4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI)", " 4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) 4.1.1 Setting The Dutch Youth Health Care (YHC) routinely monitors development of almost all children living in The Netherlands. During the first four years, there are 13 scheduled visits. During these visits, the YHC professionals evaluate growth and development of the child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI; in Dutch: Van Wiechenschema) is the standard instrument used to measure development during the ages 0-4 years. The DDI consists of 75 milestones. The instrument assesses three developmental domains: Fine motor, adaptation, personality and social behavior; Communication Gross motor The milestones are organized on two forms, one for children aged 0-15 months, and another for children ages 15-54 months. The YHC professionals administer an age-appropriate subset of milestones at each of the scheduled visits, thus building a longitudinal developmental profile for each child. 4.1.2 Description of SMOCC study The Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics (SMOCC) study is a nationally representative cohort of 2,151 children born in The Netherlands during the years 1988–1989 (Herngreen et al. 1994). The study monitored child development using observations made on the DDI during nine visits covering the first 24 months of life. The SMOCC study collected information during the first two years on 57 (out of 75) milestones. The standard set in the DDI consists of relatively easy milestones that 90 percent of the children can pass at the scheduled age. This set is designed to have maximal sensitivity for picking up delays in development. A special feature of the SMOCC study was the inclusion of additional, and more difficult, milestones beyond the standard set. The additional milestones are taken as the set for the next time point. The success percentage on additional milestones is about 50 percent. 4.1.3 Codebook of DDI 0-30 months Table 4.1: Codebook of DDI as used in the SMOCC study Item Debut Domain Label ddicmm029 1m Communication Reacts when spoken to ddifmd001 1m Fine motor Eyes fixate ddigmd052 1m Gross motor Moves arms equally well ddigmd053 1m Gross motor Moves legs equally well ddigmd056 1m Gross motor Lifts chin off table for a moment ddicmm030 2m Communication Smiles in response (M; can ask parents) ddifmd002 2m Fine motor Follows with eyes and head 30d &lt; 0 &gt; 30d ddicmm031 3m Communication vocalizes in response ddifmd003 3m Fine motor Hands open occasionally ddifmm004 3m Fine motor Watches own hands ddigmd054 3m Gross motor Stays suspended when lifted under the armpits ddigmd057 3m Gross motor Lifts head to 45 degrees on prone position ddicmd116 6m Communication Turn head to sound ddifmd005 6m Fine motor Plays with hands in midline ddigmd006 6m Gross motor Grasps object within reach ddigmd055 6m Gross motor No head lag if pulled to sitting ddigmd058 6m Gross motor Looks around to side with angle face-table 90 ddigmd059 6m Gross motor Flexes or stomps legs while being swung ddicmm033 9m Communication Says dada, baba, gaga ddifmd007 9m Fine motor Passes cube from hand to hand ddifmd008 9m Fine motor Holds cube, grasps another one with other hand ddifmm009 9m Fine motor Plays with both feet ddigmm060 9m Gross motor Rolls over back to front ddigmd061 9m Gross motor Balances head well while sitting ddigmd062 9m Gross motor Sits on buttocks while legs stretched ddicmm034 12m Communication Babbles while playing ddicmm036 12m Communication Waves ‘bye-bye’ (M; can ask parents) ddifmd010 12m Fine motor Picks up pellet between thumb and index finger ddigmd063 12m Gross motor Sits in stable position without support ddigmm064 12m Gross motor Crawls forward, abdomen on the floor ddigmm065 12m Gross motor Pulls up to standing position ddicmm037 15m Communication Uses two words with comprehension ddicmd136 15m Communication Reacts to verbal request (M; can ask parents) ddifmd011 15m Fine motor Puts cube in and out of a box ddifmm012 15m Fine motor Plays ‘give and take’ (M; can ask parents) ddigmm066 15m Gross motor Crawls, abdomen off the floor (M; can ask parents) ddigmm067 15m Gross motor Walks while holding onto play-pen or furniture ddicmm039 18m Communication Says three ‘words’ ddicmd141 18m Communication Identifies two named objects ddifmd013 18m Fine motor Tower of 2 cubes ddifmm014 18m Fine motor Explores environment energetically (M; can ask parents) ddigmd068 18m Gross motor Walks alone ddigmd069 18m Gross motor Throws ball without falling ddicmm041 24m Communication Says sentences with 2 words ddicmd148 24m Communication Understands ‘play’ orders ddifmd015 24m Fine motor Builds tower of 3 cubes ddifmm016 24m Fine motor Imitates everyday activities (M; can ask parents) ddigmd070 24m Gross motor Squats or bends to pick things up ddigmd146 24m Gross motor Drinks from cup (M; can ask parents) ddigmd168 24m Gross motor Walks well ddicmm043 30m Communication Refers to self using ‘me’ or ‘I’ (M; can ask parents) ddicmd044 30m Communication Points at 5 pictures in the book ddifmd017 30m Fine motor Tower of 6 cubes ddifmd018 30m Fine motor Places round block in board ddifmm019 30m Fine motor Takes off shoes and socks (M; can ask parents) ddifmd154 30m Fine motor Eats with spoon without help (M; can ask parents) ddigmd071 30m Gross motor Kicks ball Table 4.1 shows the 57 milestones from the DDI for ages 0 - 30 months as they were administered in the SMOCC study.

["sec-measurementmodel.html", "4.5 Measurement model for the \\(D\\)-score", " 4.5 Measurement model for the \\(D\\)-score 4.5.1 What are measurement models? From section 3.5 we quote: The measurement model specifies the relations between the data and the latent variable. The scientific theory of measurement models is known under the name of Item Response Theory (IRT). Good introductory works include Wright and Masters (1982), Embretsen and Reise (2000) and Engelhard Jr. (2013). IRT models enables quantification of the locations of both items (milestones) and persons on the latent variable. We reserve the term item for generic properties, and milestone for child development. In general, items are part of the measurement instrument, persons are the objects to be measured. An IRT model has three major structural components: Specification of the underlying latent variable(s). In this work, we restrict ourselves to models with just one latent variable. Multi-dimensional IRT models do have their uses, but they are complicated to fit and not widely used; For a given item, a specification of the probability of success given a value on the latent variables. This specification can take many forms. Section 4.6 focuses on this in more detail; Specification how probability models for the different items should be combined. In this work, we will restrict to models that assume local independence of the probabilities. In that case, the probability that two items are passed can be found by multiplying each item’s success probability. 4.5.2 Adapt the model? Or adapt the data? The measurement model induces a predictable pattern in the observed items, and this pattern can be tested against the observed data. When there is misfit between the expected and observed data, we can follow two strategies: Make the measurement model more general. Discard items (and sometimes persons) to make the model fit. These are very different strategies that have led to heated debates among psychometricians. See Engelhard Jr. (2013) for an overview. In this work, we opt for the - very strict - Rasch model (Rasch (1960)), and will adapt the data to reduce discrepancies between model and data. Arguments for this choice are given later, in Section 4.8. References "],
["sec-itemresponsefunctions.html", "4.6 Item response functions", " 4.6 Item response functions Most measurement models describe the probability of passing an item as a function of the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty. A person with low ability will almost surely fail a difficult item, whereas a highly able person will almost surely pass an easy item. Let us now introduce a few symbols. We adopt the notation used in Wright and Masters (1982). See Appendix A for a complete list. Symbol Term Description \\(\\beta_n\\) Ability True (but unknown) developmental score of child \\(n\\) \\(\\delta_i\\) Difficulty True (but unknown) difficulty of an item \\(i\\) \\(\\pi_{ni}\\) Probability Probability that child \\(n\\) passes item \\(i\\) Thus, Figure 3.6 shows three \\(\\beta_n\\)’s and four \\(\\delta_i\\)’s. The difference between ability of child \\(n\\) and difficulty of item \\(i\\) is \\[\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\] In the special case that \\(\\beta_n = \\delta_i\\), the person will have a probability of 0.5 of passing the item. 4.6.1 Logistic model A widely used method to map differences on the latent scale are logistic units (or logits) (Berkson 1944). The reason for using the logistic rather than linear units is that its output returns a probability value that is mapped to discrete events. In our case, we can describe the probability of passing an item (milestone) as a function of the difference between \\(\\beta_n\\) and \\(\\delta_i\\) expressed in logits. Figure 4.5: Standard logistic curve. Percentage of children passing an item for a given ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). Figure 4.5 shows how the percentage of children that pass the item varies in terms of the ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). The gap can vary either by \\(\\beta_n\\) or \\(\\delta_i\\), so we may use the graph in two ways: To find the probability of passing items with various difficulties for a child with ability \\(\\beta_n\\). If \\(\\delta_i = \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\delta_i &lt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\delta_i &gt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\). In words: If the difficulty of the item is equal to the child’s ability, then child has a 50/50 chance to pass. The child will have a higher than 50/50 chance of passing for items with lower difficulty, and have a lower than 50/50 chance of passing for items with difficulties that exceed the child’s ability. To find the probability of passing a given item \\(\\delta_i\\) for children that vary in ability. If \\(\\beta_n &lt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\beta_n &gt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). In words: Children with abilities lower than the item’s difficulty will have lower than 50/50 chance of passing, whereas children with abilities that exceed the item’s difficulty will have a higher than 50/50 chance of passing. Note the symmetric roles for difficulties \\(\\delta_i\\) and abilities \\(\\beta_n\\). 4.6.2 Types of item response functions The standard logistic function is by no means the only option to map the relation between the latent variable and the probability of passing an item. The logistic function is the dominant choice in IRT, but it is instructive to study some other mappings. The item response function maps success probability against ability. Figure 4.6: Item response functions for five hypothetical items, each demonstrating a positive relation between ability and probability to pass. Figure 4.6 illustrates several other possibilities. Let us consider five hypothetical items, A-E. Note that the horizontal axis now refers to ability, instead of ability-item gap in 4.5. A: Item A is the logistic function discussed in Section 4.6. B: For item B, the probability of passing is constant at 30 percent. This 30 percent is not related to ability. This item does not measure ability, and only adds to the noise. It is a bad item for measurement. C: Item C is step function centered at an ability level of 1, so all children with an ability below 1 logit fail, and all children with ability above 1 pass. This is the ideal item for discriminating children with an abilities above and below 1. The item is not sensitive to differences at other ability levels, and often not so realistic in practice. D: Like A, item D is a smoothly increasing logistic function, but it has an extra parameter that allows it to vary its slope (or discrimination). The extra parameter can make the curve steeper (more discriminatory) than the red curve, in the limit approaching a step curve. It can also become shallower (less discriminatory) than the red curve (as plotted here), in the limit approaching a constant curve (item B). Thus, item D generalizes items A, B or C. E: Item E is even more general in the sense that it need not be logistic, but a general monotonically increasing function. As plotted, the item is insensitive to abilities between -1 and 0 logits, and more sensitive to abilities between 0 to 2 logits. These are just some examples of how the relation between the child’s ability and passing probability could look. In practice, the curves need not start at 0 percent or end at 100 percent. They could also be U-shaped, of have other non-monotonic forms. See Coombs (1964) for a thorough overview of such models. In practice, most models are restricted to shapes A-D. 4.6.3 Person response functions The roles of persons and items can be switched. The person response function tells us how likely it is that a single person can pass an item, or more commonly, a set of items. Let us continue with items A, C and D from Figure 4.6, and calculate the response function for three children, respectively with abilities \\(\\beta_1 = -2\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0\\) and \\(\\beta_3 = 2\\). Figure 4.7: Person response functions for three children with abilities -2, 0 and +2, using a small test of items A, C and D. Figure 4.7 presents the person response functions from three persons with abilities of -2, 0 and +2 logits. The functions are calculated as the average of response probabilities on items A, C and D. Thus, on average, we expect that child 1 will pass an easy item of difficulty -3 in about 60 percent of the time, whereas for an intermediate item of difficulty of -1 the passing probability would be 10 percent. For child 3, with a higher ability, these probabilities are quite different: 97% and 90%. The substantial drop in the middle of the curve is caused by the step function of item A. References "],
["sec-engelhard.html", "4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement", " 4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement In this work, we strive to achieve invariant measurement, a very strict form of measurements that is subject to the following requirements (Engelhard Jr. 2013, 14): Item-invariant measurement of persons: The measurement of persons must be independent of the particular items that happen to be used for the measuring. Non-crossing persons response functions: A more able person must always have a better chance of success on an item that a less able person. Person-invariant calibration of test items: The calibration of the items must be independent of the particular persons used for calibration. Non-crossing item response functions: Any person must have a better chance of success on an easy item than on a more difficult item. Unidimensionality: Items and persons must be simultaneously located on a single underlying latent variable. This means that the relations between the items are fully explainable by the scores on the latent scale. In practice, the requirement implies that items should measure the same construct. (Hattie 1985) Three families of IRT models actually support invariant measurement: Scalogram model (Guttman 1950) Rasch model (Rasch 1960; Andrich 1978; Wright and Masters 1982) Mokken scaling model (Mokken 1971; Molenaar 1997) The Guttman and Mokken model yield an ordinal latent scale, while the Rasch model yields an interval scale (with a constant unit).

["sec-whyrasch.html", "4.8 Why take the Rasch model?", " 4.8 Why take the Rasch model? Invariant measurement: The Rasch model meets the five Engelhard criteria (c.f. Section 4.7). Interval scale: When it fits, the Rasch model provides an interval scale, the de-facto requirement for any numerical comparisons (c.f. Section 3.4.1). Parsimonious: The Rasch model has one parameter for each item and one parameter for each person. It’s one of the most parsimonious IRT models, and can easily be applied to thousands of items and millions of persons. Specific objectivity: Person and item parameters are mathematically separate entities in the Rasch model. In practice, this means that the estimated difference in ability between two persons does not depend on the difficulty of the test. Also, the estimated differences in difficulties between two items does not depend on the abilities in the calibration sample. The property is especially important in the analysis of combined data, where abilities can vary widely between sources. See Rasch (1977) for derivations and examples. Unified model: The Rasch model unifies distinct traditions in measurement theory.

The DDI scores are coded as 0 (FAIL) or 1 (PASS). In order to save horizontal space, only the last two digits of the item names are given as column headers. Since the selection of milestones depends on age, the dataset contains a large number of empty cells. Naive use of sum scores as a proxy to person ability is therefore problematic. An empty cell is not a FAIL, so it’s an error to impute those cells by zeroes. Note that some rows contain only 1’s, e.g., in row 2. Many computer program for Rasch analysis routinely remove such perfect scores before fitting. However, unless the number of perfect scores is very small, this is not recommended because doing so can severely affect the distribution of person abilities. In order to effectively handle the missing data and to preserve all persons in the analysis we separate estimation of item difficulties (c.f. section 5.2) and person abilities (c.f. section 5.3). "],
["sec-itemestimation.html", "5.2 Item parameter estimation", " 5.2 Item parameter estimation 5.2.1 Pairwise estimation of item difficulties There are many methods for estimating the difficulty parameters of the Rasch estimation. See Linacre (2004) for an overview. We will use the pairwise estimation method. This method writes the probability that child \\(n\\) passes item \\(i\\) but not item \\(j\\) given that the child passed one of them as \\(\\exp(\\delta_i) / (\\exp(\\delta_i) + \\exp(\\delta_j))\\). The method optimizes the pseudo-likelihood of all item pairs over the difficulty estimates by a simple iterative procedure. Zwinderman (1995) has shown that this procedure provides consistent estimates with similar efficiency computationally more-intensive conditional and marginal maximum likelihood methods. The beauty of the method is that it is independent of the ability distribution, so there is no need to remove perfect scores. We use the function rasch.pairwise.itemcluster() as implemented in the sirt package (Robitzsch 2016). Figure 5.1: Estimated item difficulty parameters (\\(d_i\\)) for 57 milestones of the DDI (0 - 2 years). Figure 5.1 summarizes the estimated item difficulty parameters. Although the model makes no distinction between domains, the results have been ordered to ease spotting of the natural progression of the milestones per domain. The figure also suggests that not all domain are equally represented across the scale. For example, there are no communication milestones around the logit of \\(-10\\). 5.2.2 Anchoring The Rasch model identifies the item difficulties up to a linear transformation. By default, the software produces estimates in the logit scale (c.f. Figure 5.1). The logit scale is inconvenient for two reasons: The logit scale has negative values. Negative values do not have a sensible interpretation in child development, and are likely to introduce errors in practice; Both the zero in the logit scale as well as its variance depend on the sample used to calibrate the item difficulties. The properties of the Rasch model are preserved under a rescaling of the derived scale. In order to make the scale independent of the specified sample, we transform the scale so that two items will always have the same value on the transformed scale. The choice of the two anchor items is essentially arbitrary, but they should correspond to milestones that are easy to measure with small error. In the sequel, we use the two milestones to anchor the \\(D\\)-score scale: Table 5.2: Anchoring values used to identify the \\(D\\)-score scale Item Label Value ddigmd057 Lifts head to 45 degrees on prone position 20 ddigmd063 Sits in stable position without support 40 With the choice of Table 5.2, \\(D\\)-score values are approximately 0\\(D\\) around birth. At the age of 1 year, the score will around 50\\(D\\), so during the first year of life, one \\(D\\) unit corresponds to approximately a one-week interval. Figure 5.2: Estimated item difficulty parameters (\\(d_i\\)) for 57 milestones of the DDI (0 - 2 years). Milestones ddigmd057 and ddigmd063 are anchored at values of 20\\(D\\) and 40\\(D\\), respectively. References "],
["sec-dscoreestimation.html", "5.3 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score", " 5.3 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score The second part of the estimation process is to estimate a \\(D\\)-score. The \\(D\\)-score quantifies the development of a child at a given age. Whereas the estimation of item parameters is typically done by the instrument developer, \\(D\\)-score estimation is more of a task for the user. In order to calculate the \\(D\\)-score we need the following ingredients: Child’s PASS/FAIL scores on the milestones administered; The difficulty estimates of each milestone administered; A prior distribution, an estimate of the \\(D\\)-score distribution before seeing any PASS/FAIL score. Using these inputs, we may use Bayes theorem to calculate the position of the person on the latent variable. 5.3.1 Role of the starting prior The first two inputs to the \\(D\\)-score will be obvious. The third component, the prior distribution, is needed in order to be able to deal with perfect responses. The prior distribution summarizes our knowledge about the \\(D\\)-score before we see any of the child’s PASS/FAIL scores. In general, we like to prior to be non-informative, so that the value of the \\(D\\)-score is entirely determined by the observed responses and the item difficulties. In practice, we cannot use truly non-informative prior because that would leave the \\(D\\)-score for perfect responses (i.e., all PASS or all FAIL) undefined. The choice of the prior is essentially arbitrary, but we can make it in such a way that its impact on the value \\(D\\)-score is negligible, especially for tests where we have more than, say, four items. Since we know that the \\(D\\)-score depends on age, a logical choice for the prior is to make it dependent on age. More in particular, we will define the prior as a normal distribution equal to the expected mean in Figure 4.3 at the child’s age, and with a standard deviation that considerably larger than in Figure 4.3. Numerical example: the mean \\(D\\)-score at the age of 15 months is equal 53.6\\(D\\). The standard deviation in Figure 4.3 varies between 2.6\\(D\\) and 3.0\\(D\\), with an average of 2.9\\(D\\). After some experimentation, we found that using a value of 5.0\\(D\\) for the prior yields a good compromise between, on the one hand, non-informativeness and, on the other hand, robustness of \\(D\\)-score estimates for perfect patterns. The resulting starting prior for a child aged 15 months is thus defined as \\(N(53.6, 5)\\). The reader now probably wonders about a chicken-and-egg problem: In order to calculate the \\(D\\)-score we need a prior, and in order to determine the prior we need the \\(D\\)-score. So how did we calculate the \\(D\\)-scores in Figure 4.3? The answer is that we first took at rougher prior, and calculated two temporary solutions in succession using the \\(D\\)-scores obtained after solution 1 to inform the prior before solution 2, and so on. It turned out that \\(D\\)-scores in Figure 4.3 hardly changed after two steps, and so there we stopped. 5.3.2 Starting prior: Numerical example Figure 5.3: Age-dependent starting priors for the D-score at the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months Figure 5.3 illustrates starting distributions (priors) chosen according to the principles set above for the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months. As expected, the assumed ability of an infant aged of 1 month is much lower than that of a child aged 15 months, which in turn is lower than the ability of a toddler aged 24 months. The green distribution for 15 months corresponds to the normal distribution \\(N(53.6, 5)\\). Another choice that we need to make is the grid of points on which we calculate the prior and posterior distributions. Figure 5.3 uses a grid from -10\\(D\\) to +80\\(D\\), with a step size of 1\\(D\\). These are fixed quadrature points, and there are 91 of them. While these quadrature points are sufficient to estimate \\(D\\)-score for ages up to 2.5 years, it is wise to extend the range for older children with higher \\(D\\)-scores. 5.3.3 EAP algorithm The method for estimating the \\(D\\)-score is known as the Expected a posteriori (EAP) method, first described by Bock and Mislevy (1982). Calculation of the \\(D\\)-score proceeds item by item. Suppose we have some vague and preliminary idea about the distribution of \\(D\\), the starting prior (c.f. section 5.3.1), based on age. The procedure uses Bayes rule to update this prior knowledge with data from the first item (using the child’s FAIL/PASS score and the estimated item difficulty) to calculate the posterior. The next step uses this posterior as the prior to process the next item, and so on. The procedure stops when all items have been used. The order in which items are entered does not matter for the end result. The \\(D\\)-score is equal to the mean of the posterior calculated after the last item. 5.3.4 EAP algorithm: Numerical example Suppose we measure two boys aged 15 months, David and Rob, by the DDI. David passes the first four milestones, but does not complete the test. Rob completes the test, but fails on two out of five milestones. Table 5.3: Scores of David and Rob on five milestones from the DDI Item Label Delta David Rob ddifmd011 Puts cube in and out of a box 46.0 1 1 ddifmm012 Plays ‘give and take’ (M; can ask parents) 46.5 1 0 ddicmm037 Uses two words with comprehension 50.1 1 1 ddigmm066 Crawls, abdomen off the floor (M; can ask parents) 46.1 1 1 ddigmm067 Walks while holding onto play-pen or furniture 46.1 0 Table 5.3 shows the difficulty of each milestone (in the column labelled “Delta”), and the responses of David and Rob for the standard five DDI milestones for the age of 15 months. The mean \\(D\\)-score for Dutch children aged 15 months is 53.6\\(D\\), so the milestones are easy to pass at this age, with the most difficult being ddicmm037. David passed all milestones, but has no score on the last. Rob fails on ddifmm012 and ddigmm067. How do we calculate the \\(D\\)-score for David and Rob? Figure 5.4: \\(D\\)-score distribution for David and Rob before (prior) and after (posterior) a milestone is taken into account. Figure 5.4 shows how the prior transforms into the posterior after the measurement outcomes is fed into the calculation. There are five milestones, and so calculation is done in five steps: Both David and Rob pass ddifmd011. The prior (light green) is the same as in Figure 5.3. After a PASS, the posterior will be located more to the right, and will often be more peaked. Both happen here, but the change is small. The reason is that a PASS on this milestone is not very informative. For a child with a true \\(D\\)-score of 53\\(D\\), the probability of passing ddifmd011 is equal to 0.966. If passing is so common, there is not much information in the measurement. David passes ddifmm012 but Rob does not. Observe that the prior is identical to the posterior of ddifmd011. For David, the posterior is only slightly different from the prior, for the same reason as above. For Rob, we find a huge change to the left, both in terms of location (from 54.3\\(D\\) to 47.1\\(D\\)) and in terms of peakedness. This one FAIL lowers Rob’s score by 7.2\\(D\\). Milestone ddicmm037 is more difficult than the previous two milestones, so a pass on ddicmm037 does have a clear effect on the posterior for both David and Rob. David’s PASS on ddigmm066 does not bring any additional information, so his prior and posterior are virtually indistinguishable. For Rob, we find a slight effect to the right. There is no measurement for David on ddigmm067, so the prior and posterior are equivalent. For Rob, we observe a FAIL, which shifts his posterior to the left. The \\(D\\)-score is calculated as the mean of the posterior. David’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 55.7\\(D\\). Note that the measurement error, as estimated from the variance of the posterior, is fairly large. Rob’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 47.7\\(D\\), with a much smaller measurement error. This result is consistent with the design principles of the DDI, which is meant to detect children with developmental delay. The example illustrates that the effects of the measurement on the \\(D\\)-score depend on the match between the true (but unknown) \\(D\\)-score of the child and the difficulty of the milestone. 5.3.5 Technical observations on \\(D\\)-score estimation Administration of a very easy set of milestones introduces a ceiling with children that pass all milestones, but whose true \\(D\\)-score could extend well beyond the ceiling. Depending on the goal of the measurement, this may or may not be a problem. The specification of the prior and posterior distributions requires a set of quadrature points at which their densities are calculated. The set of quadrature is taken here as the static and evenly-spaced set of integers between -10 and +80. Using other quadrature points may have an effect on the estimate, especially if the range of the quadrature points is too short. The actual calculations are here done item by item. A more efficient method is to handle all responses at once. The end result will be the same. References "],
["sec-reference.html", "5.4 Age-conditional references", " 5.4 Age-conditional references 5.4.1 Motivation The last step involves estimation an age-conditional reference distribution for the \\(D\\)-score. This distribution can be used to construct growth charts that portray the normal variation in development. In addition, the references can be used to calculate age-standarized \\(D\\)-scores, called DAZ, that emphasize the location of the measurement in comparison to age peers. Estimation of reference centiles is fairly standard. Here we follow van Buuren (2014) to fit age-conditional references of the \\(D\\)-score for boys and girls combined by the LMS method. The LMS method by Cole and Green (1992) assumes that the outcome has a normal distribution after a Box-Cox transformation. The reference distribution has three parameters, which model respectively the location (\\(M\\)), the spread (\\(S\\)), and the skewness (\\(L\\)) of the distribution. Each of the three parameters can vary smoothly with age. 5.4.2 Estimation of the reference distribution The parameters are estimated using the BCCG distribution of gamlss 5.1-3 (Stasinopoulos and Rigby 2007) using cubic splines smoothers. The final solution used a log-transformed age scale and fitted the model with smoothing parameters \\(\\mathrm{df}(M)=2\\), \\(\\mathrm{df}(S)=2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{df}(L)=1\\). Figure 4.3 plots the \\(D\\)-scores together with five grey lines, corresponding to the centiles -2SD (P2), -1SD (P16), 0SD (P50), +1SD (P84) and +2SD (P98).

["sec-itemfit.html", "6.1 Item fit", " 6.1 Item fit The philosophy of the Rasch model is different from conventional statistical modeling. It is not the task of the Rasch model to account for the data. Rather it is the task of the data to fit the Rasch model. We saw this distinction before in Section 4.5.2. The goal of model fit assessment is to explore and quantify how well empirical data meet the requirements of the Rasch model. One way to gauge model fit is to compare the observed probability of passing an item to the fitted item response curve for endorsing the item. The fitted item response curve for each item \\(i\\) is modeled as: \\[P_{ni} = \\frac{\\exp(\\hat\\beta_{n} - \\hat\\delta_{i})}{1+\\exp(\\hat\\beta_{n}-\\hat\\delta_{i})},\\] where \\(\\hat\\beta_n\\) is the estimated ability of child \\(n\\) (the child’s \\(D\\)-score), and where \\(\\hat\\delta_i\\) is the estimated difficulty of item \\(i\\). Chapter 5 describes process of parameter estimation in detail. 6.1.1 Well-fitting item response curves Figure 6.1: Empirical and fitted item response curves for two milestones from the DDI (SMOCC data). The study of item fit involves comparing the empirical and fitted probabilities at various levels of ability. Figure 6.1 shows the item characteristics curves of two DDI milestones. The orange line represents the empirical probability at different ability levels. The dashed line represents the estimated item response curve according to the Rasch model. The empirical and estimated curves are close together, so both items fit the model very well. 6.1.2 Item response curves showing severe underfit There are many cases where things are less bright. Figure 6.2: Three simulated items that illustrate various forms of item misfit. Figure 6.2 shows three forms of severe underfit from three hypothetical items. These items were simulated to have a low fit, added to the DDI, and their parameters were estimated by the methods of Chapter 5. For the first item, hypgmd001, the probability of passing is almost constant across ability, so retaining this item essentially only adds to the noise. Item hypgmd002 converges to an asymptote around 80 percent and has a severe dip in the middle. The dip is caused by the strong relation to age. Item hypgmd003 appears to have the wrong coding. In addition, the spike-like behavior in the middle is often seen when two or more different items are erroneously given identical item names. Removal of items with a low fit can substantially improve overall model fit. 6.1.3 Item response curves showing overfit Figure 6.3: Two simulated items that illustrate item overfit. Figure 6.3 shows two hypothetical items with two forms of overfit. The curve of item hypgmd004 is much steeper than the modeled curve. Thus, just this one item is exceptionally well-suited to distinguish children with a \\(D\\)-score below 50\\(D\\) from those with a score above 50\\(D\\). Note that the item isn’t sensitive anywhere else on the scale. In general, having items like these is good news, because they allow us to increase the reliability of the instrument. One should make certain though, that FAIL and PASS scores are all measured (not imputed) values. Multiple perfect items could hint to a violation of the local independence assumption (c.f. Section 4.5). Developmental milestones sometimes have combinations of responses that are impossible. For example, one cannot walk without being able to stand, so the inconsistent combination (stand: FAIL, walk: PASS) will not be observed. This leads to more consistent responses that would be expected by chance alone. In principle, one could combine the two such items into one three-category items, which effectively set the probability of inconsistent combinations to zero. Item hypgmd005 is also steep, but has an asymptote around 80 percent. This causes discrepancies between the empirical and modeled curves around the middle of the probability scale. In general, such items could be removed if a sufficient number of better items are available. 6.1.4 Item infit and outfit Item fit can quantified by item infit and outfit. Both are aggregates of the model residuals. The observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) of person \\(n\\) on item \\(i\\) can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). The standardized residual \\(z_{ni}\\) is the difference between the observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) and the expected response \\(P_{ni}\\), divided by the expected binomial standard deviation, \\[z_{ni} = \\frac{x_{ni}-P_{ni}}{\\sqrt{W_{ni}}},\\] where the expected response variance \\(W_{ni}\\) is calculated as \\[W_{ni} = P_{ni}(1-P_{ni}).\\] Item infit is the sum of the squared residuals divided by the sum of the expected response variances \\(W_{ni}\\) \\[\\mathrm{Item\\ infit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_n^N W_{ni}}.\\] Item outfit is calculated as the average (over \\(N\\) measurements) of the squared standardized residual \\[\\mathrm{Item\\ outfit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N z_{ni}^2}{N}.\\] The expected value of both infit and outfit is equal to 1.0. The interpretation is as follows: If infit and outfit are 1.0, then the item perfectly fits the Rasch model, as in Figure 6.1; If infit and outfit &gt; 1.0, then the item has underfit. The amount of underfit is quantified by infit and outfit, as in 6.2; If infit and outfit &lt; 1.0, then the item fits the model better than expected (overfit). The amount of over fit is quantified by infit and outfit, as in 6.3. Infit is more sensitive to discrepancies in the middle of the probability scale, whereas outfit is the better measure for discrepancies at probabilities close to 0 or 1. Lack of fit is generally easier to spot at the extremes. The two measures are highly correlated. Infit is generally considered more important. Values near 1.0 are desirable. There are no cut-and-dried cutoff values for infit and outfit. In general, we want to remove underfitting items, e.g., item with infits or outfits higher than, say, 1.3. Overfitting items with values lower than 1.0 are not harmful. Preserving these items may actually help to increase reliability of the scale. The cut-off chosen also depends on the number of available items. When there are many items to choose from, we could use a stricter criterion, say infit and outfit &lt; 1.0 to select only the absolutely best items. 6.1.5 Infit and outfit in the DDI Figure 6.4: Frequency distribution of infit (left) and outfit (right) of 57 milestones from the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.4 displays the histogram of the 57 milestones from the DDI (c.f. Section 4.1). Most infits are within the the range 0.6 - 1.1, thus indicating excellent fit. The two milestones with extremely low infits are ddigmd052 and ddigmd053. These two items actually screen for paralysis for newborns, so the data contain hardly any fails on these milestones. The outfit statistics also indicate good fit. "],
["sec-personfit.html", "6.2 Person fit", " 6.2 Person fit The person fit quantifies the extent to which the responses of a given child conform to the Rasch model expectation. The Rasch model expects that a more able child has a greater probability to pass an item than a less developed child. Person fit analysis evaluates the extent to which this is true. 6.2.1 Person infit and outfit In parallel to item fit, we can calculate person infit and person outfit. Both statistics evaluate how well the responses of the persons are consistent with the model. The outfit statistic is heavily influenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. Outfit is high, for example, when the child fails easy items but passes difficult items. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlaying, on-target, unexpected responses. Similar to item fit, person fit is also calculated from the residuals, but aggregated in a different way. Person infit is calculated as \\[\\mathrm{Person\\ infit} = \\frac{\\sum_{i}^L (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_i^L W_{ni}}\\] and person outfit is \\[\\mathrm{Person\\ outfit} = \\frac{\\sum_{i}^L z_{ni}^2}{L}\\] As a threshold for person fit &lt; 3.0 can be used to clean out children with implausible response patterns. 6.2.2 Person infit and outfit in the DDI Figure 6.5: Frequency distribution of person infit (left) and person outfit (right) for 16538 measurements of the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.5 displays the frequency distribution of person infit and person outfit 16538 measurement of the DDI in the SMOCC data. The large majority of the values falls below 3.0. For infit, only 43 out of 16538 measurements (0.3 percent) is above 3.0. For outfit, there are 446 out of 16538 measurement (2.7 percent) above 3.0. Expect the solution to improve after deleting these measurements. "],
["sec-dif.html", "6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF)", " 6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF) 6.3.1 Relevance of DIF for cross-cultural equivalence An important assumption in the Rasch model is that a given item has the same difficulty in different subgroups of respondents. Climbing stairs is an example where this assumption is suspect. The exposure to stairs, and hence the opportunity for a child to practice, varies across different cultures. It could thus be that two children with the same ability but from different cultures have different success probabilities for climbing stairs. When these probabilities systematically vary between subgroup, we say there is Differential Item Functioning, or DIF (Holland and Wainer 1983). DIF is undesirable since it can make the instrument culturally biased. 6.3.2 How to detect DIF? Zumbo (1999) provided a clear definition of DIF: DIF occurs when examinees from different groups show differing probabilities of success on (or endorsing) the item after matching on the underlying ability that the item is intended to measure. There are various ways to detect DIF. Here we will model the probability of endorsing an item by logistic regression using the observed item responses as outcome, and with ability, the grouping variable, and the ability-grouping interaction as predictors. When the latter two terms explain the residual variance of the item scores after adjusting for ability, the item presents DIF for that group. DIF can be visually inspected by plotting the curves for the subgroups separately. The are two forms of DIF: Uniform DIF: The item response curves differ between groups in location, but are parallel; Non-uniform DIF: The item response curve differ between groups in location, in slope and possibly in other characteristics. These forms correspond to, respectively, the main effect of group and the ability-group interaction in the logistic regression model. 6.3.3 Examples of DIF Figure 6.6: Two milestones from the DDI with similar item response curves for boys and girls. There is no DIF for sex. Figure 6.6 shows an example comparing boys and girls. For both milestones, the item response curves are similar for boys and girls, so we see no evidence of DIF here. Figure 6.7: Two milestones from the DDI with different item response curves for boys and girls. There is evidence for uniform DIF. Figure 6.7 displays two milestones with DIF between boys and girls. Provided that the ability estimate (as estimated from all milestones in the model) is fair for both boys and girls, we see that milestone ddifmm019 (“Takes off shoes and socks”) is easier for girls by about 0.86 logits (= the difference in ability at the intersection of 50 percent). Conversely, milestone ddigmm064 (“Crawls forward, abdomen on the floor”) is easier for boys by about 0.84 logits. These are the largest differences found for sex in the DDI. Both are uniform DIF. In practice, having milestones with opposite forms of DIF in the same instrument will cancel out one another, so one need not be overly concerned in that case. However, we should be careful when the instrument consists of milestones that all have DIF in the same direction. The DDI did not contain items for which the ability-group interaction was statistically significant, so we conclude that there is no non-uniform DIF in the DDI. References "],
["sec-iteminformation.html", "6.4 Item information", " 6.4 Item information 6.4.1 Item information at a given ability Items are generally sensitive to only a part of the ability scale. Item information is a psychometric measure that quantifies how informative the item is at different levels of ability. Item information can be plotted as a curve for each item. The formula to obtain the item information is the first derivative of the item response curve and can be written as follows: \\[I(\\hat\\delta_i)=P(\\hat\\delta_i)(1-P(\\hat\\delta_i))\\] where \\(P(\\hat\\delta_i)\\) is the conditional probability of endorsing item \\(i\\), and where \\(\\hat\\delta_i\\) is the estimated item difficulty in the logit scale. For example for milestone ddicmm039 (“Says three words”) \\(\\hat\\delta_i\\) equals \\(4.06\\). Figure 6.8: The item information curve for two milestones from the DDI. Figure 6.8 displays the item information curves for two milestones from the DDI. Note that the amount of information for the item is maximal around the item difficulty. The probability of endorsing milestone ddicmm039 for a child with an ability of \\(2\\) logits is \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{\\exp(2 - 4.06)}{1+\\exp(2-4.06)} = 0.113\\] At this ability level, milestone ddicmm039 has information \\[I(\\hat\\delta_i)=0.113 \\times (1-0.113) = 0.10\\] 6.4.2 Item information at a given age In practice, it is often interesting to express the item information against age. By doing so, one can identify at what ages an item provides the most information. Figure 6.9: Information information of Figure 6.8 plotted against age. Figure 6.9 shows that the sensitive age ranges differ considerably between items. Using 0.05 as a criterion, milestone ddigmm060 is sensitive between ages 4–8 months, whereas ddicmm039 is sensitive between ages 10–19 months, a range that is about twice as broad. The symmetric nature of the curves in Figure 6.8 is not present Figure 6.9. In general, the relation between age and item sensitivity is more complex than the relation between ability and item sensitivity. The item information by age curve helps to determine at what ages the item can best be administered. The item will be most informative if administered at the age at which 50% of the children will pass the milestone, which is the point where the item information is equal to 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Administering the item closely around that age provide the most efficient measurement of ability. When space is at premium (e.g. as in population surveys) using a well-chosen set of age-sensitive milestones will help in reducing the total number of milestones that needs to be measured. In other contexts, milestones may be used as a screening instrument to identify developmental delay. In that case, it is more efficient to administer items that are very easy for the age, e.g. milestones on which, say, 90% of the children will pass. "],
["sec-reliability.html", "6.5 Reliability", " 6.5 Reliability The reliability is a one-number summary of the accuracy of an instrument. Statisticians define reliability as the proportion of variance attributable to the variation between children’s abilities relative to the total variance. More specifically, the reliability \\(R\\) of a test is written as \\[R \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{\\beta}^2}{\\sigma_{\\beta}^2 + \\sigma_{e}^2},\\] where \\(\\sigma_{\\beta}^2\\) is the variance of true scores and \\(\\sigma_{e}^2\\) is the error variance. In general, a high reliability is desirable, so the reliability of a test is often used to decide between instruments. Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) is a popular estimate of the lower bound of the reliability of a test. In the Rasch model, we can estimate reliability by the ratio \\[\\hat{R} = \\frac{\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2 - \\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2}{\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2}.\\] For a given model, we can calculate \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2\\) directly as the sampling variance of the estimated abilities, but getting an estimate for \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2\\) is more difficult. We use the modeled abilities and modeled difficulties to generate a hypothetical data set of the same size and same missing data pattern, and re-estimate the abilities from the simulated data. Then \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2\\) is computable as variance of the difference between the modeled abilities and the re-estimated abilities. The estimated variance of the modeled abilities is \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2 = 76.6\\), and the variance of the difference between modeled and re-estimated abilities is equal to \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2 = 1.74\\). The corresponding standard error of measurement (sem) is \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e} = 1.32\\) logits. The estimated reliability in the SMOCC data can now be calculated as \\((76.6-1.74)/76.6 = 0.977\\). This number can be interpreted in the same way as Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\), for which typically any value beyond 0.9 is classified as excellent. Note that the reliability is very high because of the large variation in \\(D\\)-scores. Newborns are very different from 2-year old toddlers, which helps to increase reliability. In practice, it is perhaps more useful to use a measure of accuracy that is less dependent on the variation within the sample. The sem, as explained above, seems to be a more relevant measure of precision. "],
["ch-validity.html", "Chapter 7 Validity", " Chapter 7 Validity Author: Iris Eekhout Validity is a generic term that refers to the question how well an instrument measures what it claims to measure. There are many various aspect of validity. This chapter briefly reviews the main types of validity: Internal validity (7.1) External validity (7.2) "],
["sec-internal.html", "7.1 Internal validity", " 7.1 Internal validity 7.1.1 Content validity Content validity is the extent to which the \\(D\\)-score represents all facets of development. In contrast to “face validity”, which assesses whether the test appears valid to respondents, content validity is about what is actually measured. One important form of content validity is that we wish to make sure that the measurement scale represents the various developmental domains in a fair way. In the simplest case, we can assign each milestone uniquely to one domain, and evaluate coverage by splitting the cumulative item information over domains. Figure 7.1: Cumulative item information by DDI domain. Figure 7.1 shows the coverage of the three domains of the DDI at various levels of the \\(D\\)-score. The three domains of the DDI are represented at most ability levels. The DDI contains no communication milestones between 20 \\(D\\) and 30 \\(D\\), so at these levels the DDI measures primarily motor performance. 7.1.2 Construct validity Construct validity is the extent to which the \\(D\\)-score behaves like the theory says the construct should behave. For example, we expect that child development advances with by age. Figure 4.3 provides convincing evidence that the \\(D\\)-score increases fastest in the first six months, and keeps rising at a slower rate as children age. This is consistent with theories in growth and child development. Figure 7.2: Item fit by \\(D\\)-score for the DDI domains. In Chapter 4 we assumed that child development can be measured by one latent variable. Figure 7.2 provides one way to evaluate the validity of this assumption. The figure plots the item fit for each milestone colored by domain. Items from different domains fit equally well, so there is no evidence that the \\(D\\)-score is tilted towards a particular domain. Put in more technical terms, the DDI domains do not explain differences in the item fit residuals of the model. "],
["sec-external.html", "7.2 External validity", " 7.2 External validity 7.2.1 Discriminatory validity Discriminatory validity indicates the extent to which the \\(D\\)-score can distinguish children with non-normal development from children that are developing normally. We may evaluate this by identifying children with lagging development, for example indicated by reflex and/or tonus problems, and study whether the \\(D\\)-score is able to discriminate those children from the general population. Section 9.3 presents some examples. 7.2.2 Convergent and divergent validity Convergent validity is the extent to which the \\(D\\)-score relates to similar constructs. It can be measured by the correlation with other instrument that measure development. Examples include the total score for Bayley-III or the Denver. For a good convergent validity the correlation with other construct should be 0.6, or higher. Unfortunately, at present only limited data is for the DDI, so we cannot assess convergent validity for the \\(D\\)-score at this point. Divergent validity is the extent to the \\(D\\)-score is uncorrelated with measures that are different construct. Figure 7.3: (ref:plotconcurrent) (ref:plotconcurrent) Relation between body height and the \\(D\\)-score in the SMOCC data. Figure 7.3 shows both convergent and divergent validity at work. The figure shows that, as expected, there is a strong and almost linear relation between body height and the \\(D\\)-score. However, after correction for child’s age, the relation between height and \\(D\\)-score almost disappears. This indicates that, given age, growth and development are quite different concepts. We can also evaluate the strength of the relation between the \\(D\\)-score and measures that are currently used as a proxy for child development, such as stunted height growth (see section 1.3). The low correlation between DAZ and HAZ suggests that stunting is a bad proxy for child development. 7.2.3 Predictive validity Predictive validity refers to the degree to which the \\(D\\)-score predicts score on a criterion that is measured late in time. For the \\(D\\)-score we have measures for IQ at the age of 5 as a possible criterion. Vlasblom et al. (2019) found strong evidence that individual milestones of the DDI measured during the first years of life are predictive of later attendance of special education at ages 5–10 years. It is to be expected that the \\(D\\)-score, which is built upon these items, will also predict limited intellectual functioning. References "],

["sec-comparingd.html", "8.2 \\(D\\)-score from short tests", " 8.2 \\(D\\)-score from short tests 8.2.1 Milestone sets In the analyses done thus far we have calculated \\(D\\)-scores from responses on the combined (standard plus additional) milestones. Thus, at the 2-month visit, the \\(D\\)-score was calculated from 2 (standard) + 5 (additional) = 7 milestones. In daily practice, the set of additional milestones is often lacking. This chapter explores the impact of using the (smaller) subset of standard milestones on measurement error and prediction. This section reports and compares three \\(D\\)-scores: \\(D\\)-score from standard milestones; \\(D\\)-score from additional milestones. \\(D\\)-score from all available milestones; Estimation of 1 is more difficult than for 2 and 3, for the following reasons: There are fewer milestones, so the estimate is less precise and more influenced by the choice of the prior distribution; The standard set contains only easy milestones, which are uninformative for the majority of children. 8.2.2 Milestone sets at month 2 Figure 8.2: (ref:month2d) (ref:month2d) Distribution of the \\(D\\)-scores calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones at month 2. Colors correspond to the number of fails. The vertical axis of Figure 8.2 shows the \\(D\\)-score, separately calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones for children aged 2 months. The color of the dots represents the number of FAIL scores within each set of milestones. At month 2 there are just two standard milestones: ddicmm030 and ddifmd002. About 90 percent of the infants will pass these. The estimated \\(D\\)-scores corresponding to two passes is represented by the green dots in the left-hand side figure. As explained in Section 5.3.2, the \\(D\\)-score is calculated by using an age-dependent prior. If the ages vary (and they do), then the \\(D\\)-score for infants having the same total score will also vary. If a child fails on either ddicmm030 or ddifmd002, then the \\(D\\)-score is substantially lower. The left-hand figure shows a gap between the green dots (perfect score) and the yellow dots (one FAIL). The impact of a FAIL on the \\(D\\)-score is substantial. For example, the \\(D\\)-score of an infant with one FAIL on a standard milestone drops from about 20\\(D\\) to 14\\(D\\). Thus, with these two milestones there cannot be a \\(D\\)-score in the range 15\\(D\\) - 18\\(D\\). It depends on the purposes of the measurement whether this is acceptable. We can prevent such gaps by measuring more milestones, e.g., milestones taken from the additional set. Another gap occurs between 14\\(D\\) and 11\\(D\\). These gaps illustrate that precision is constrained when only two milestones are administered. The middle figure shows the estimated \\(D\\)-score at the same visit, but now calculated from the five additional milestones (i.e., the standard milestones from month 3). Infant aged 2 months have approximately a 50 percent chance of passing each. Note that administration of the additional milestones will cover the range 14\\(D\\)-20\\(D\\) quite well. Note the ceiling is also higher with these milestones. Note that the range of the estimated \\(D\\)-scores is quite similar in both plots. This is because \\(D\\)-score estimation takes the difficulty level of milestones into account. The estimate of the \\(D\\)-score is unbiased for difficulty. The figure on the right hand side provides the \\(D\\)-score calculated from all available milestones. We can easily recognise the points coming from the standard and additional sets. In addition, there is a limited number of scores on easier milestones that belong to month 1. These milestones were rescored because the child failed these milestones at the previous visit. Rescoring effectively extends the range of possible \\(D\\)-scores to the lower end, so now we can find some children who have \\(D\\)-score lower than 10\\(D\\). 8.2.3 Milestone sets at month 3 Figure 8.3: (ref:month3d) (ref:month3d) Distribution of the \\(D\\)-scores calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones at month 3. Colors correspond to the number of fails. Figure 8.3 is the same plot as before, but now for month 3. Compared to Figure 8.2 all points shifted upwards because the children are now one month older. The additional milestones from month 2 are the standard milestones of month 3. In Figure 8.2 there were at least 11 children (in purple) failed all five additional milestones. One month later, there is one child having five fails. 8.2.4 Floor and ceiling effects Figure 8.4: (ref:alld) (ref:alld) \\(D\\)-score by age 0-30 months for standard, additional and all available milestones at each measurement occasion. Figure 8.4 plot the \\(D\\)-score distribution for all occasions. Some observations: Ceiling effect: The ceiling effect (green) is most prominent in the standard set, but is also present in the other two sets. None of the three sets is able to filter out children with really advanced development. In order to achieve more precision at the upper end, we would need to include more difficult milestones. Floor effect: There are almost no floor effects in the standard and all sets. These sets discriminate well among children with delayed development, which was the design purpose of the DDI. Floor effects visible in the additional set. Average level: All three sets capture the overall relation between age and development. The additional set is quite efficient for measuring average levels development, but lacks detail on the extremes. Figure 8.4 shows that a short test (5-6 milestones) can precisely measure the lower tail of the \\(D\\)-score distribution (standard set) or the middle of the \\(D\\)-score distribution (additional set), but cannot do both at the same time.

["sec-predictiq.html", "8.3 Impact of short tests on predicting IQ", " 8.3 Impact of short tests on predicting IQ 8.3.1 Measurement and prediction In Section 8.2 we saw that a short test can measure the middle or one tail of the distribution, but cannot be precise for both at the same time. If we want to identify children at risk for delayed development, we are interested in the lower tail of the distribution, so in that case the standard set is suitable. But what set should we use if we want to predict a later outcome? This section explores that effect of taking different milestone sets on the quality of prediction. 8.3.2 UKKI Hafkamp-de Groen et al. (2009) studied the effect of the \\(D\\)-score on later intelligence, using a subset of 557 SMOCC children that were followed up at the age of five years. Intelligence was measured by the Utrechtse Korte Kleuter Intelligentietest (UKKI) (Baarda 1978). The UKKI is a simple test with just three components: Redraw five figures (square, triangle, cross, trapezoid, rhomboid); Draw human figure, with 28 characteristics, like legs, eyes, and so on; Give meaning to 13 words like knife, banana, umbrella, and so on. Administration time is about 15-20 minutes. The UKKI has a reasonable test-retest reliability for group use (Pearson \\(r = 0.74\\), 3-month interval). 8.3.3 Exploratory analysis Figure 8.5: (ref:histiq) (ref:histiq) Histogram of UKKI IQ scores taken around the age of five years (SMOCC data, \\(n = 557\\)). Figure 8.5 shows the empirical IQ distribution of 557 children. The mean IQ score is 108 and the standard deviation is 15, so the IQ-scores of children in the sample is about a half standard deviation above the 1978 reference sample. Figure 8.6: (ref:plotdiq) (ref:plotdiq) Relation between \\(D\\)-score at infancy and IQ at age 5 years according to three milestone sets and nine visits (SMOCC data, \\(n = 557\\)). Figure 8.6 shows that the relation between the \\(D\\)-score 0-2 years and IQ at 5 years is positive for all milestone sets and for all ages. The strength of the relation increases with age. At the age of 2 years, the regression coefficient for \\(D\\)-score is equal to \\(\\beta(D) = 1.4\\) (SE: \\(0.21, p &lt; 0.0001\\)), so on average an increase of 1.0 unit in the \\(D\\)-score at the age of 2 years corresponds to a 1.4 IQ-score points increase at the age 5 years. Table 8.2: Pearson correlation between D-score (0-2 years) and IQ at 5 years Visit Standard set Additional set All milestones 1m 0.058 0.010 0.033 2m 0.043 0.054 0.043 3m 0.034 0.100 0.101 6m 0.041 0.038 0.036 9m 0.095 0.143 0.132 12m 0.049 0.159 0.135 15m 0.193 0.155 0.197 18m 0.137 0.150 0.153 24m 0.245 0.254 0.272 Table 8.2 summarizes the Pearson correlations between the \\(D\\)-score and later IQ. The association between \\(D\\)-score and IQ is weak during the first year of life, but gets stronger during the second year. In general, having more (and more informative) milestones helps to increase the correlation, but the effects are relatively small. So even from the standard set of the seven easy milestones at 24m we obtain a reasonable correlation of 0.245. All in all, these results suggest that neither the amount nor the difficulty level of the milestones are critical in determining the strength of the relation between the \\(D\\)-score and IQ.

Ages are corrected for preterm birth by a factor of 0.75 (Source: POPS data, 450 children, 4 occasions). Figure 9.2 presents the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ distributions for the POPS cohort of children born very preterm or with very low birth weight. All in all, the distributions of the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ are similar to those found in the SMOCC study. Since the \\(D\\)-scores are calculated using the same milestones and difficulty estimates as used in the SMOCC data, the \\(D\\)-scores are comparable across the two studies. When the milestones differ between studies (e.g. when studies use different measurement instruments) it is still possible to calculate \\(D\\)-scores. This problem is a little more difficult, and will be addressed in booklet II. The primary new complication here is the question whether it is fair compare postnatal age of children born a term with postnatal ages of very preterm children. This section focuses on this issue in some detail. 9.2.1 POPS design In 1983, the Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants (POPS study) collected data on all 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth (gestational age &lt; 32 weeks) or very low birth weight (birth weight &lt; 1500 grams). See Verloove - Vanhorick et al. (1986) for details. Gestational age was determined from the best obstetric estimate, including last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. The POPS study collected measurements on 450 children using the DDI at four visits at corrected postnatal ages of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. 9.2.2 Age-adjustment Assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause over-diagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children. Very preterm children may require additional time to enable development equivalent to that of normal term birth children. In anthropometry, it is common to correct chronological age of very preterm born children so as to enable age-appropriate evaluation of growth. For example, suppose the child is born as a gestational age of 30 weeks, which is 10 weeks early. A full correction would deduct 10 weeks from the child’s postnatal age, and a half correction would deduct 5 weeks. More in particular, we calculate corrected age (in days) as: \\[ \\mathrm{corrected\\ age} = \\mathrm{postnatal\\ age}\\mathrm{\\ (days)} - f \\times [280 - \\mathrm{gestational\\ age\\ (days)}], \\] where 280 is the average gestational age in days, and where we specify several alternatives for \\(f\\) as 1.00 (full correction), 0.75, 0.50 (half) or 0.00 (no correction). Let’s apply the same idea to child development. Using corrected age instead of postnatal age has two consequences: It will affect the prior distribution for calculating the \\(D\\)-score; It will affect DAZ calculation. We evaluate these two effects in turn. 9.2.3 Effect of age-adjustment on the \\(D\\)-score Figure 9.3: (ref:adjustd) (ref:adjustd) Scatterplot of two versions of the \\(D\\)-score, one calculated using postnatal age (\\(f = 0.00\\)), the other calculated using full age-adjustment (\\(f = 1.00\\)). Figure 9.3 plots the fully age-adjusted \\(D\\)-score against the unadjusted \\(D\\)-score. Any discrepancies result only from differences in the ages used in the age-dependent prior (c.f. Section 5.3.2). All points are on or below the diagonal. Age-adjustment lowers the \\(D\\)-score because a preterm is “made younger” by subtracting the missed pregnancy duration, and hence the prior distribution starts off at the lower point. For example, the group of red points with \\(D\\)-scores between 30\\(D\\) and 40\\(D\\) (age not corrected) will have \\(D\\)-scores between 20\\(D\\) and 30\\(D\\) when fully corrected. Note that only the red points (with perfect scores) are affected. The impact of age-correction on the \\(D\\)-score is negligible when the child fails on one or more milestones. 9.2.4 Effect of no age adjustment (\\(f = 0.00\\)) on the DAZ Figure 9.4: (ref:popsda90) (ref:popsda90) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score and DAZ without age correction for preterm birth (\\(f = 0.00\\)). Figure 9.4 illustrates that a considerable number of \\(D\\)-scores fall below the minus -2 SD line of the reference when age is not adjusted, especially during the first year of life. The pattern suggests that the apparent slowness in development is primarily the result of being born early, and does not necessarily reflect delayed development. 9.2.5 Effect of full age adjustment (\\(f = 1.00\\)) on the DAZ Figure 9.5: (ref:popsda91) (ref:popsda91) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score and DAZ under full age correction for preterm birth (\\(f = 1.00\\)). Full age correction has a major effect on the DAZ. Figure 9.5 illustrates that the POPS children are now somewhat advanced over the reference children. This may reflect the effect of longer exposure to sound and vision ex-utero, so developed in preterms may actually be more advanced than that of term peers. Full age correction seems to overcorrect the \\(D\\)-score, so it is natural to try intermediate values for \\(f\\) between 0 and 1. 9.2.6 Partial age adjustment Table 9.1: Average DAZ at various ages under four correction factors.

Setting \\(f = 0.75\\) seems a good compromise, in the sense that the average DAZ is close to zero in the first age interval. The average DAZ is negative at later ages. It is not known whether this genuinely reflects less than optimal development of very preterm and low birth weight children, so either \\(f = 1.00\\) and \\(f = 0.75\\) are suitable candidates. 9.2.7 Conclusions Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age 5 months when chronological age was fully corrected; Fewer preterm children reached the milestones when chronological age was not corrected; Fewer children reached the milestones when \\(f = 0.50\\) correction was used; Similar proportions were observed when \\(f = 0.75\\) was used within the first 5 months after birth. After chronological age 5 months, similar proportions were observed between very preterm and full term children when chronological age was fully corrected.

Figure 9.6 presents the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ distributions of a sample of children living near Kpalimé, Togo. While the main trend with age conforms to the previous data, the distributions differ from those in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 in two respects: Compression at upper end: Most of the \\(D\\)-scores are above the median curve, which suggests that, at these ages, children living in Togo develop faster than children living in the Netherlands; Expansion at lower end: There is a huge variation in \\(D\\)-scores on the lower end, with many \\(D\\)-scores below the -2 SD curve, suggesting that some children are significantly more delayed than would be expected in both Dutch samples.

USD 46,180 in the Netherlands), and USD 744 for low income countries in general (data.worldbank.org). The data were collected by Cécile Schat-Savy, who initiated a youth health care center modeled after the Dutch youth health care system in Kpalimé, Togo. See https://www.kinderhulp-togo.nl for background. Data monitoring included a french translation the DDI for measuring child development. Data were gathered from about 9747 individuals in the 0-18 age range. Participants include children and their parents who visited the Kpalimé health center at least one time. Kpalimé is the fourth biggest town in Togo, but the health center also attracted parents and children from a wide surrounding rural area. Parents visited the health center for several reasons, including for a preventive health check or because of their child’s apparent health problems. The possibility of visiting the health center was advertised to parents through information sessions for parents at primary schools. Parents paid a small amount of money per visiting child (about USD 4.00 for children of 4 years or older, and USD 0.80 for children younger than 4 years). All data were registered in paper dossiers. Data were digitized by four local data-assistants, and on a regular basis mailed to TNO in the Netherlands to check for completeness and consistency. Figure 9.7: Three of the data-assistants who helped to digitize the paper files. Here we use a subset of 2674 visits from 1644 unique children who were scored on the 57 milestones of the DDI 0-2 years. \\(D\\)-scores could not be calculated when either age or DDI data were missing, which leaves a dataset of 2425 visits from 1567 children. The number of visits that parents of these children in the 0-4 age range paid to the health center varied from 1 – 9, but the majority of children were seen once. 9.3.2 \\(D\\)-score labelled by neurological problem Figure 9.8: (ref:togoda1) (ref:togoda1) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by neurological (tonus and/or reflex) problems. (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.8 is the same scatter plot as in Figure 9.6, but now marked by whether the physician registered signs of neuropathology in the form of tonus and reflex problems. Many children with low \\(D\\)-scores also have tonus and/or reflex problems. This finding alone suggests that extreme \\(D\\)-score are not artifacts (e.g. caused by a wrongly coded age), but actually indicate major adverse health conditions. 9.3.3 \\(D\\)-score labelled by Apgar score Figure 9.9: (ref:togoda2) (ref:togoda2) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by Apgar score (10 minutes) lower than 8. (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.9 identifies the children who had an Apgar score at 10 minutes after birth that was lower than 8. About half of these children had a \\(D\\)-score below -2 SD curve. 9.3.4 \\(D\\)-score labelled by severe underweight Figure 9.10: (ref:togoda3) (ref:togoda3) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by severe underweight (WAZ &lt; -4) (Source: TOGO data). Many children who visited the Kpalimé health center had a low body weight for their age. Figure 9.10 marks the subset of severely underweight children (WAZ &lt; -4). A substantial proportion of these children also had a very low \\(D\\)-score. 9.3.5 \\(D\\)-score labelled by severe stunting Figure 9.11: (ref:togoda4) (ref:togoda4) Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by severe stunting (HAZ &lt; -4) (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.11 is similar to 9.10, but now marked by the subset of severely stunted children (HAZ &lt; -4). Also, here a sizable proportion has a low \\(D\\)-score. When taken together, Figures 9.8-9.11 show that children with very low \\(D\\)-scores often experience (multiple) harsh health problems. Those health problems may have substantially delayed their development.

Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.12 shows large differences in gross motor development between children from Togo and from the Netherlands. For example, at the age of three months, about 30 percent of the Dutch infants succeed in controlling their head when pulled to sitting. However, infants from Togo are already capable to control their head when they are just one month old! Moreover, the advantage persists at least until up to the age of two years: children in Togo can roll over and sit much earlier, or kick a ball without falling. As the documentary Babies shows, African children even manage to learn to walk with a tin can on their head, a craft that not many westerners can dream of. 9.3.7 Fine motor development Figure 9.13: (ref:finemotor) (ref:finemotor) Fine motor milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.13 shows a less pronounced but similar phenomenon for fine motor skills. These data suggest that children in Togo have generally better fine motor skills than the children from two Dutch cohorts. 9.3.8 Communication and language Figure 9.14: (ref:commun) (ref:commun) Communication and language milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.14 summarizes the data for three milestones on communication and langauge. In general, the success probability is similar in the three studies. One curious finding is that the high proportion of milestones passes in ddicmm041 for the Togo children around the age of 18 months. Note that several of the green lines in Figures 9.12-9.14 start off close to perfect scores, which makes is impossible to show the rising patterns found in the Dutch data. It may be indeed be true that children from Togo develop more rapidly than Dutch children. It would be desirable if these results could be backed up from other sources. "],
["sec-threestudiesconclusions.html", "9.4 Conclusions", " 9.4 Conclusions This chapter compared the \\(D\\)-scores estimated from the DDI administered to three different groups of children. We found that The \\(D\\)-score by age plot showed postive, curved relation with age in all three studies; Children born very preterm and/or with very low birth weight had similar development to reference children when their age was corrected for early birth; A relatively small subset of children born in Togo had extremely low \\(D\\)-scores, not found in the Netherlands, likely the result of underlying neuropathology, severe underweight and/or severe stunting; On average, children from Togo seemed to faster development during the first two years, especially in motor development. All in all, these findings support the usefulness and validity of the \\(D\\)-score as an informative summary of generic development of children during their first two years of life. "],
["ch-nextsteps.html", "Chapter 10 Next steps", " Chapter 10 Next steps Author: Stef van Buuren This booklet provides a quick overview of the relevance, concepts and techniques behind the \\(D\\)-score. While the results obtained thus far are encouraging, some questions will certainly remain when the method is put to practice. A rough selection of such questions includes: What is the added value of the \\(D\\)-score in practice? Does the \\(D\\)-score extend to higher ages? Is the assumption of uni-dimensionality reasonable for other ages and populations? Can the \\(D\\)-score be calculated from instruments other than the DDI? Is it reasonable to assume that milestone difficulty is identical in other populations? Does the method apply to caregiver-reported milestones? Would a dedicated \\(D\\)-score instrument be more efficient? How many milestones are “enough”? Can the same scale be used for measurement at individual, group and population levels? Can the \\(D\\)-score detect delayed development? Would the \\(D\\)-score help to target early interventions? This chapter briefly reviews some of these issues. "],
["usefulness-of-d-score-for-monitoring-child-health.html", "10.1 Usefulness of \\(D\\)-score for monitoring child health", " 10.1 Usefulness of \\(D\\)-score for monitoring child health The \\(D\\)-score is a new approach to measure child development. The \\(D\\)-score is a scale for quantifying generic child development by a single number. Milestones are selected to fit the Rasch model. The resulting measurements can be interpreted as scores on an interval scale, a requirement for answering questions like: What is the difference in development over time for the same child, group or population? What is the difference in development between different children, groups or populations of the same age? How does child development compare to a norm? The \\(D\\)-score is not tied to a particular instrument. Any instrument that fits the model underlying the \\(D\\)-score can be used to measure the child’s \\(D\\)-score. The precision of the measurement depends on the number of milestones used, as well as on the match between the difficulty of the milestones and the ability level of the measured child. The measurement instrument can thus be tailored to the question at hand. "],
["d-chart-a-growth-chart-for-child-development.html", "10.2 \\(D\\)-chart, a growth chart for child development", " 10.2 \\(D\\)-chart, a growth chart for child development The field of child growth and development roughly divides into two areas: The subfield child growth (or auxology) emphasizes body measures like height, weight, body mass index, and so on. It is a rigorous quantitative science with intimate ties to statistics since the days of Quetelet and Galton. The subfield child development is more recent and builds upon a wide-ranging set of domain-specific instruments for measuring motor, language, cognitive and behavioral states. The growth chart is a widely used tool to monitor physical growth. The \\(D\\)-score can be used in a similar way to create the \\(D\\)-chart. Figure 10.1: \\(D\\)-chart with five children from the SMOCC study. Figure 10.1 shows developmental trajectories of five randomly chosen children from the SMOCC study. Note that the trajectory can be created even though the milestones are different at different ages. The trajectory may help to track development of a child on a periodic basis. The \\(D\\)-chart shows that it is straightforward to apply quantitative techniques from child growth to child development. Our hope is that \\(D\\)-score aids in bridging the somewhat disparate subfields of child growth and child development. "],
["opportunities-for-early-intervention.html", "10.3 Opportunities for early intervention", " 10.3 Opportunities for early intervention Black et al. (2017) estimated that about 250 million children worldwide fail to reach their developmental potential. Developmental delays become evident in the first year, and worsen during early childhood. The burden of children not reaching their developmental potential is high. Interventions aimed at improving child development should be delivered at the sensitive periods for maximum effect. Programs are to be comprehensive, incorporating a combination of health, nutrition, security and safety, responsive care-giving and early learning. See Engle et al. (2011) and Grantham‐McGregor et al. (2014) for recent overviews. Both estimation of intervention effects as well as comparison across different treatments is hampered by the absence of universal measure for child development. The lack of a common yardstick may have adverse impact on proper policy and priority setting. Since the \\(D\\)-score is not tied to a particular instrument, our hope is that it may help in improving decision making, ultimately lowering the number of children not reaching their developmental potential.

["d-score-for-international-settings.html", "10.4 \\(D\\)-score for international settings", " 10.4 \\(D\\)-score for international settings Chapter 9 compared \\(D\\)-scores between three study samples. The analysis was simplified by the fact that all three studies used the same instrument (the DDI, in Togo translated to French) to measure child development. It is difficult to compare levels of child development worldwide. Existing estimates on children not reaching their developmental potential rely on proxies, such as stunting and poverty. While these proxies have been found to correlate with child development, they are only weak indicators of actual child performance. Arguably, the performance of a child on a set of well-chosen milestones is more informative for his or her future health and productivity than body height or parental income. One way to improve the quality on child development estimates is to use the same instrument worldwide. While simple in theory, such a pre-harmonization approach is difficult in practice, and may require huge and continued investments by a central agency. Moreover, it does not address historic data, so it will be difficult to see secular trends. The \\(D\\)-score opens up an interesting alternative: agree on the scale, and leave some liberty to the data-collector in the exact choice of the instrument. This may be a better use of the data-collector’s expertise of the local population, and may be more successful in keeping up with innovations in measurement. Booklet II will address some of the conceptual and technical issues that arise when we attempt to apply the \\(D\\)-score to other populations. "],
["d-score-from-existing-instruments.html", "10.5 \\(D\\)-score from existing instruments", " 10.5 \\(D\\)-score from existing instruments There is a huge base of historic child developmental data using, of course, existing instruments. The problem is that each instrument defines its own summaries, and these summaries cannot be compared across instruments. Different instrument have different domains, different age forms, different stopping rules, different age norms, and so on. Yet, the milestones in these instruments are often very similar. Most instruments collect data on milestones like: Can the child stack two blocks? Can the child roll over? Can the child draw a cross? Can the child stand? Can the child say “baba”? With the \\(D\\)-score methodology in hand, we are ready to exploit the overlap in common milestones from different instrument. Common items can act as bridges between instruments, so - with the appropriate item-level data - we may attempt calculating \\(D\\)-scores from other instruments as well. Booklet II will explore this possibility in more detail. "],
["creating-new-instruments-for-d-score.html", "10.6 Creating new instruments for \\(D\\)-score", " 10.6 Creating new instruments for \\(D\\)-score Extending the \\(D\\)-score to other instruments has the side-effect of extending the itembank with good items. Moreover, as more and more data feed into the itembank, assessment of already present milestones may become more precise. The enlarged and improved itembank then may act as the basic resource for creating instruments for particular settings. For example, if the interest is on finding the most advanced children, we may construct a difficult test that will separate the good and the best. Alternatively, we can use the item bank to create and administer computerized adaptive tests (Wainer et al. 2000, @jacobusse2007), a sequential method that select the next milestone based on the previous test outcome. Booklet III will explore the conceptual and technical challenges, and propose an integrated approach to support instrument construction and validation. References "],
