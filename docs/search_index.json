["sec-first1000.html", "1.1 First 1000 days", " 1.1 First 1000 days The first 1000 days refers to time needed for a child to grow from conception to the second birthday. It is a time of rapid change. During this period the architecture of the developing brain is very open to the influence of relationships and experiences (Shonkhoff et al. 2016). Early experiences affect the nature and quality of the brain’s developing architecture by determining which synapses are reinforced, and which are pruned through lack of use. During the first 1000 days, brain architecture is basically shaped, but higher-order brain functions still continue to develop into adolescence and early adulthood (Kolb, Harker, and Gibb 2017). Figure 1.1: Serve and return interactions shape brain architecture. Source: Shonkhoff et al. (2016). The classic nature versus nurture debate contrasts the viewpoints that variation in development is primarily due to either genetic or environmental differences. The current scientific consensus is that virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental differences (Rutter 2007). The environment in which a child develops (before and soon after birth) provides experiences that can modify the expression of certain genes (Caspi et al. 2010). Negative influences, such as exposure to stressful life circumstances or environmental toxins, leave a chemical signature on the genes. During the first 1000 days, infants are highly dependent on their caregivers to protect them from adversities and to help them regulate their physiology and behavior. Caregivers can do this through responsive care, including routines for sleeping and feeding. To reach their developmental potential, children require nutrition, responsive care-giving, opportunities to explore and learn, and protection from environmental threats (Black et al. 2017). Gradually, children build self-regulatory skills that enable them to manage stress as they interact with their caregivers (S. Johnson et al. 2013). References "],
["sec-relevance.html", "1.2 Relevance of child development", " 1.2 Relevance of child development The first 1000 days is a time of rapid change. At the same time, deprivation in the first 1000 days can seriously undermine the developing child. In situations where caregivers are unable to protect and buffer their infants from adverse exposures, this can place an infant at risk for mental health problems (S. Johnson et al. 2013). The physiological consequences of early adversities have been well documented and linked to difficulties with self-regulation and anxiety throughout childhood and adolescence (Burkholder et al. 2016). Young children who have been exposed to adversity or violence do not invariably develop stress-related disorders. While they are at greater risk, they can also be helped substantially if reliable and nurturing relationships with supportive caregivers are established, and if appropriate treatments are provided as needed (Belsky and Fearon 2002). An important protective factor for infants and young children in high-risk situations is a secure attachment to their caregivers. The adverse effects of cumulative risk and conditions of deprivation are reduced substantially by secure parent-child attachments (Sciaraffa, Zeanah, and Zeanah 2018). References "],
["sec-stunting.html", "1.3 Stunting as proxy for child development", " 1.3 Stunting as proxy for child development Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psycho social stimulation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the Child Growth Standards median. Stunting caused by chronic nutritional deprivation in early childhood can be considered as an indicator of (poor) child development (Perkins et al. 2017). Figure 1.2: Seven eight-year old children standing in front of a wall with the line depicting the average height according to the WHO Child Growth Standards. There is consistent evidence for the association between stunting and poor child development, despite heterogeneity in the magnitude of associations (Miller et al. 2016; Sudfeld et al. 2015). Linear growth in children is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age in comparison to normative growth standards (Wit et al. 2017). Considering impaired linear growth as a proxy measure for child development is easy to do, and in fact quite common. Yet, using impaired height growth as measure for child development is not without limitations: The relation between height and child development is weak after adjustment for age; Height is a physical indicator that does not take into account a direct evaluation of a child’s cognitive or mental performance; There is considerable heterogeneity in heights of children all over the world, and it is not clear how much of this variation is attributable to differences in child development; Height is not sensitive to rapid changes in child development.

["sec-neurocognitive.html", "1.4 Measuring neurocognitive development", " 1.4 Measuring neurocognitive development Assessment of early neurocognitive development in children is challenging for many reasons (Ellingsen 2016). During the first years of life developmental change occurs rapidly, and the manifestation of different skills and abilities varies considerably across children. Moreover, a child’s performance on a cognitive task is very susceptible to measurement setting. Recently, a toolkit was published that reviews 147 assessment tools that have been developed for children ages 0–8 years in low- and middle-income countries (Fernald et al. 2017). The ideal child development assessment is easy to administer, has high reliability, validity, and cross-cultural appropriateness. It should also show appropriate sensitivity in scores at different ages and ability levels. It will be no surprise that no test can meet all of these criteria. Many tests are too long, difficult to administer, lack cross-cultural validity or have low reliability. In addition, many of the measurement instruments are proprietary, and costly to use. Some of the most widely used tools include the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Each of these tools has its strengths and limitations. References "],
["sec-why.html", "1.5 Why this booklet?", " 1.5 Why this booklet? We believe that there cannot be one instrument for measuring child development that is suitable for all situations. In general, the instrument needs to be tailored to the setting. For example, in order to find individual children with delayed development, we need an instrument that is precise for the individual child. But in order to compare different countries on child development, we need an instrument that is culturally unbiased and for which measurements can be made rapidly in a large number of children. These two instruments need to be different. We also believe that there can be one scale for measuring child development. It would be extremely useful if different instruments can produce numbers on the same scale. This booklet explores the theory for making that happen. "],

["sec-definitions.html", "2.1 What is child development?", " 2.1 What is child development? In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what exactly constitutes child development. One of the first rigorous studies in the field (Shirley 1931) was executed under the explicit aim … that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously. Shirley gave empirical definitions of each of these domains of development. Figure 2.1: Gross motor development as a sequence of milestones. Source: Shirley (1933). Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure 2.1 illustrates the various stages needed for going from a fetal posture to walking alone. The ages are indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in timing between infants. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development: Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in an orderly sequence. Gesell’s definition emphasizes that development is a continuous process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves. Liebert, Poulos, and Strauss (1974) (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon that unfolds in isolation. Development refers to a process in growth and capability over time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with the environment. N. Cameron and Bogin (2012) (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows: “Growth” is defined as an increase in size, while “maturity” or “development” is an increase in functional ability…The endpoint of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate successfully … not just biological maturity but also behavioral and perhaps social maturity. Berk (2011) (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on child development as follows: Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions, each representing a different skill area that may undergo both continuous and stagewise transformation. There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given here just illustrate the main points of view in the field. References "],
["sec-theories.html", "2.2 Theories of child development", " 2.2 Theories of child development The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g. Santrock (2011), Berk (2011)), or by searching for the topic of interest in an encyclopedia (e.g. Salkind (2002)). The introductions by Santrock (2011) and Berk (2011) both distinguish major theories in child development according to how each answers to following three questions: 2.2.1 Continuous or discontinuous? Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring from one stage to another? Many stage-based theories of human development have been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by psycho-sexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by Erikson (Erikson 1963), Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (Kohlberg 1984) and Piaget’s cognitive development theory (Piaget and Inhelder 1969). Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout childhood. The first period, the sensimotor period (approximately 0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these six stages describe “the road to conceptual thought”. Piaget’s stages are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism in intellectual development. On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a continuous process. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) says: A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on. 2.2.2 One course or many? Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the work of Gesell. The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion, so there may be multiple ways to reach the same point. Figure 2.2 illustrates that the path taken by a given child will depend on the child’s unique combination of personal and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in development. Figure 2.2: A representation of the dynamic systems viewpoint on how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point using different paths. Source: Berk (2011). 2.2.3 Nature or nurture? Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question how to explain individual differences. Maturation usually defined as the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that differences in development are innate and stable over time, but that there may be differences in speed. Others argue that individual differences are primarily driven by environmental factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child development. The answer — if there is one — in this stability-versus-plasticity debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that differences are natural and stable, then it may not make sense trying to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to be small. On the other hand, if we view development as plastic, then improving the environment may have substantial pay-offs in terms of improved development. References "],

Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of the baby’s walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room, and lightly greases the soles of the baby’s feet with olive oil. The baby was invited to “walk” on the sheet. Of course, very young infants need substantial assistance. Footprints left were later colored by graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were repeated every week or bi-weekly.

Table 2.1 lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and walking alone, as taken from Table 3 in van Buuren and Leeuw (1992). Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark in the first column the babies were already stepping when the observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she could walk alone. 2.3.2 Individual trajectories of motor development Figure 2.3: Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Figure 2.3 is a visual representation of the information in Table 2.1. Each data point is the age of first occurrence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs, there is a jump to the next level. The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry) or who jump over stages (Martin, Max). For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no sensible interpretation. We might be inclined to think that the vertical distance portrays to how difficult it is to achieve the next stage, but this is inaccurate. Instead, difficulty of passing from one stage to the next corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction between stages. For example, on average the line for stepping is rather short in all plots, so going from stepping to standing is relatively easy. The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher. Shirley (1931) actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure 2.3 plot only the 76 visits that showed a jump. In order to obtain individual curves like these, the data collection needs to be intense and costly. Fortunately, there are alternatives that are much more efficient. References "],

["sec-agebased.html", "3.1 Age-based measurement of development", " 3.1 Age-based measurement of development 3.1.1 Motivation for age-based measurement The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to describe the behavior expected at a selected age. Gesell (1943) (p. 89) formulates this goal as follows: We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age. There is a large literature that quantifies development in terms of ages at which the child is expected to show a specific behavior. For example, in Shirley’s motor data in Table 2.1, we may summarize the ages at which each of the 21 children enters a given stage. Figure 3.1: Ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. 3.1.2 Age equivalent as difficulty Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of a given developmental milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of the age at which children achieve it. For example, Stott (1967) (p. 25) defines the age equivalent and its use for measurement, as follows: The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age at which children reach that particular stage. Figure 3.2: Boxplot and mean (symbol x) of the ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. Figure 3.2 adds boxplot and the mean age at which the children enter the four stages. The difficulty of the stages can thus be expressed as age equivalents: 16.1 weeks for stepping, 27.2 weeks for standing, 43.3 weeks for walking with help and 63.3 weeks for walking alone. Alternatives to the mean age equivalent include the ages at which 10, 50 or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of reasoning has led to the widely used concept of developmental age as a measure of a child’s development (in body size or motor skill or psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms. 3.1.3 Limitations of age-based measurement Age-based measurement is easy to understand, but is not without pitfalls: Age-based measurement can inform us whether a child is earlier or later for a given milestone. However, it does not tell us what behaviors are characteristic for a child of a given age. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there is no norms, we cannot quantify development. Age-based measurement intertwines quantification of development with evaluation of development. Age-based measurement only works at the milestone level, and is cumbersome to apply with multiple milestones. References "],
["sec-scorebased.html", "3.2 Score-based measurement of development", " 3.2 Score-based measurement of development 3.2.1 Motivation for score-based measurement Score-based measurement takes the responses on multiple milestones and counts the total number of passed milestones as a measure of child’s development. This approach takes multiple measurement into account, hence leading to a more stable measurement. If milestones are ordered in difficulty, so one may skip milestones that are too easy, and stop when milestones become too difficult for the child, for example as age-forms. In such cases, we cannot simply interpret the sum score of a measure of development, and need to correct for the subset of milestones that was actually administered. The usual working assumption is that the child would have passed all easier milestones and failed on all more difficult milestones. This procedure is typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor, cognitive, and so on. 3.2.2 Example of score-based measurement Figure 3.3: Same data as in Figure 2.3, but now with the vertical axis representing gross-motor score. Figure 3.3 is a gross-motor score calculated as the number of milestones passed. It varies from 0 to 3. The plot suggests that the difference in development between scores 0 and 1 is the same as the difference in development between, say, scores 2 and 3. This is not true. For example, suppose that we express difficulty of the milestone as an age-equivalent. From section 3.1.2 we see that the difference in difficulty between stepping and standing is 27.2 - 16.1 = 11.1 weeks, whereas the difference between walking alone and walking with help is 63.3 - 43.3 = 20 weeks. Thus, according to age equivalents scores 0 and 1 should be closer to each other, and scores 2 and 3 should be drawn wider apart. 3.2.3 Limitations of score-based measurement Score-based measurement is today’s dominant approach, but is not without conceptual and logistical issues. The total score depends not only on the (true) developmental status of the child, but also on the set of milestones actually administered. If a milestone is skipped or added, the sum score cannot be interpreted anymore as a measure of the child’s developmental status. It is not possible to compare scores made by different instruments. Some instruments allows conversion to age-conditional scores. However, the sample used to derive such conversions are typically restricted to one instrument, and does not extend to measurements made by other instruments. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive milestones tap into fine motor capabilities, and vice verso. There are different ways to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The materials are often proprietary and sometimes costly. "],
["sec-unitbased.html", "3.3 Unit-based measurement of development", " 3.3 Unit-based measurement of development 3.3.1 Motivation for unit-based measurement Unit-based measurement starts by defining the ideal properties of the measurement, and derives a procedure to aggregate the responses on milestones into an overall score that will meet the ideal. Section 2.4 highlighted questions for individuals, groups and populations. There are basically three questions: What is the difference in development over time for the same child, group or population? What is the difference in development between different children, groups or populations of the same age? How does child development compare to a norm? In the ideal situation, we would like to have a continuous (latent) variable \\(D\\) (for development) that measures child development. The scale should allow us to quantify ability of persons, groups or populations from low to high. The scale should have a constant unit, so that a given difference in ability quantifies means the same across the entire scale, just like that a difference of 10 cm means the same irrespective of whether we compare the heights of books or houses. When are these conditions are met, we say that we measure on an interval scale. If we succeed in creating an interval scale for child development, an enormous arsenal of technique developed for quantitative variables opens up to measure, track and analyze child development. We may then evaluate the development of a child in terms of \\(D\\) points gained, create age-dependent charts for development (just like growth charts for height and weight), devise age-conditional measures for child development, and intelligent adaptive testing schemes. Promising studies on Dutch data (G. Jacobusse, van Buuren, and Verkerk (2006), G. Jacobusse and van Buuren (2007), van Buuren (2014)) suggest that such benefits are well within reach. 3.3.2 Example of unit-based measurement Table 3.1: Hypothetical (bi-)weekly measurements as

Table 3.1 reconstructs the weekly motor measurements made by Shirley from Table 2.1. Each of the measurements is coded as a PASS (1) or a FAIL (0). It is now straightforward to calculate the probability of passing each milestone at different ages. Figure 3.4: Probability of achieving four motor milestones against age. Data from Table 3.1. Figure 3.4 plots the empirical probability curves of passing each motor milestone. Observe there if a gradual decline in the steepness as we move from stepping to walk_alone. This pattern of flattening is typical for child development, and is evidence that development is faster at earlier ages. Thus, it takes less time to go from 10 to 90 percent in stepping than it takes for walk_alone. Figure 3.5: Modeled probability of achieving four motor milestones against the \\(D\\)-score. Data from Table 3.1. Figure 3.5 is similar to Figure 3.4, but with Age is replaced by Ability, and with the empirical curves replaced by modeled curves. The ability values on the horizontal axis are estimated from the data and correspond to the amount of development of each measurement. Also, the logistic curves are estimated from the data, and reflect the probability of passing each milestone at a given level of ability. The figure shows that the probability of passing an milestone increases with ability. Milestones are ordered in difficulty from left to right. Milestone stepping is the easiest and walk_alone is most difficult. The point at which a logistic curve crosses the 50 percent line (marked by a cross) is customarily taken as the difficulty of the milestone. The increase in ability that is needed to go from 10 to 90 percent is about five units here. Since all curves are parallel, the interval is constant for all scale locations. Thus, the scale is an interval scale with a constant unit of measurement. This is the type of measurement scale needed for answering the basic questions identified in Section 3.3.1. 3.3.3 Limitations of unit-based measurement While unit-based measurement has many advantages, it cannot perform miracles. An important assumption is that the milestones “measure the same thing”, or put differently, are manifestations of an underlying continuous latent variable that can be measured by empirical observations. Unit-based measurement won’t work if there is no sensible latent scale. The portrayed advantages hold only if the discrepancies between the data and the model are relatively small. Since the simplest and most powerful measurement models are very strict, it is important to assess and increase the fit between data and model. The construction of unit-based measurement requires psychometric expertise, specialized computer software and considerable sample sizes. References "],
["sec-whatismeasurement.html", "3.4 What is measurement?", " 3.4 What is measurement? Measurement is the process of locating milestones and children on a line. This line represents a latent variable, a continuous construct that defines the different poles of the concept that we want to measure. In our case, the concept is child development. Other constructs, like height, temperature or happiness would be equally valid constructs. A latent variable ranges from low to high. A latent variable cannot be measured directly. It is a theoretical construct. Figure 3.6: Placing milestones and children onto the same line reveals their positions. Figure 3.6 shows the imaginary positions on a gross-motor continuum of three babies from Figure 2.1 at the age of 30 weeks. Both milestones and children are ordered along the continuum. Thus, standing is more difficult than stepping, and at week 30, Doris is ahead of Walley in terms of motor development. Latent variable cannot be measured directly. However, we may be able to actually measure variables (milestones) that are related to the latent variable. For example, we may have the child’s scores on tasks like standing or walking with help. The measurement model specifies the relations between the data and the latent variable. Under a given measurement model, we may estimate the locations of milestones and children on the line. Section 4.5 discusses measurement models in more detail. "],
["sec-whyunit.html", "3.5 Why unit-based measurement", " 3.5 Why unit-based measurement Table 3.2: Evaluation of three measurement approaches on nine criteria. Criterion Age-based Score-based Unit-based Independent of age norm NO YES YES Supports multiple milestones NO YES YES Latent variable NO YES YES Robust to milestone skipping YES NO YES Comparable scores YES NO YES Probability model NO NO YES Defines measurement unit NO NO YES This chapter distinguished three approaches to measure child development: age-based, score-based and unit-based measurement. Table 3.2 summarizes how the approaches evaluate on nine criteria. Age-based measurement expresses development in age equivalents, whose precise definition depends on the reference population. Age-based measurement does not support multiple milestones, and does not used the concept of a latent variable. Score-based measurement quantifies development by summing the number of passes. Different instruments make different selections of milestones, so the measurements taken are unique to the instruments, so comparing the measurement obtained by different instruments is difficult. Corrections are needed if milestones are skipped or added. Unit-based measurement defines a unit of measurement by a theoretical model. When the data fit the model, we are able to construct instruments that produce measurement in a common metric. "],

["sec-ddi.html", "4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI)", " 4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) 4.1.1 Setting The Dutch Youth Health Care (YHC) routinely monitors development of almost all children living in The Netherlands. During the first four years, there are 13 scheduled visits. During these visits, the YHC professionals evaluate growth and development of the child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI; in Dutch: Van Wiechenschema) is the standard instrument used to measure development during the ages 0-4 years. The DDI consists of 75 milestones. The instrument assesses three developmental domains: Fine motor, adaptation, personality and social behavior; Communication Gross motor The milestones are organized on two forms, one for children aged 0-15 months, and another for children ages 15-54 months. The YHC professionals administer an age-appropriate subset at each of the scheduled visits, thus building a longitudinal developmental profile for each child. 4.1.2 Description of SMOCC study The Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics (SMOCC) study is a a nationally representative cohort of 2,151 children born in The Netherlands during the years 1988–1989 (Herngreen et al. 1994). The study monitored child development using observations made on the DDI during nine visits covering the first 24 months of life. The SMOCC study collected information during the first two years on 57 (out of 75) milestones. The standard set in the DDI consists of relatively easy milestones that 90 percent of the children can pass at the scheduled age.

Children who did not pass a milestone at the debut age were re-measured on that milestone during the next visit. This process was continued until a PASS was recorded. References "],

["sec-measurementmodel.html", "4.5 Measurement model for the \\(D\\)-score", " 4.5 Measurement model for the \\(D\\)-score 4.5.1 What are measurement models? From section 3.4 we quote: The measurement model specifies the relations between the data and the latent variable. The scientific theory of measurement models is known under the name of Item Response Theory (IRT). Good introductory works include Wright and Masters (1982), Embretsen and Reise (2000) and Engelhard Jr. (2013). IRT models enables quantification of the locations of both items (milestones) and persons on the latent variable. We reserve the term item for generic properties, and milestone for child development. In general, items are part of the measurement instrument, persons are the objects to be measured. An IRT model has three major structural components: Specification of the underlying latent variable(s). In this work, we restrict ourselves to models with just one latent variable. Multi-dimensional IRT models do have their uses, but they are complicated to fit and not widely used; For a given item, a specification of the probability of success given a value on the latent variables. This specification can take many forms. Section 4.6 focuses on this in more detail; Specification how probability models for the different items should be combined. In this work, we will restrict to models that assume local independence of the probabilities. In that case, the probability that two items are passed can be found by multiplying each item’s success probability. 4.5.2 Adapt the model? Or adapt the data? The measurement model induces a predictable pattern in the observed items, and this pattern can be tested against the observed data. When there is misfit between the expected and observed data, we can follow two strategies: Make the measurement model more general. Discard items (and sometimes persons) to make the model fit. These are very different strategies that have led to heated debates among psychometricians. See Engelhard Jr. (2013) for an overview. In this work, we opt for the - very strict - Rasch model (Rasch (1960)), and will adapt the data to reduce discrepancies between model and data. Arguments for this choice are given later, in Section 4.8. References "],
["sec-itemresponsefunctions.html", "4.6 Item response functions", " 4.6 Item response functions Most measurement models describe the probability of passing an item as a function of the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty. A person with low ability will almost surely fail a difficult item, whereas a highly able person will almost surely pass an easy item. Let us now introduce a few symbols. We adopt the notation used in Wright and Masters (1982). See Chapter 11 for a complete list. Symbol Term Description \\(\\beta_n\\) Ability True (but unknown) developmental score of child \\(n\\) \\(\\delta_i\\) Difficulty True (but unknown) difficulty of an item \\(i\\) \\(\\pi_{ni}\\) Probability Probability that child \\(n\\) passes item \\(i\\) Thus, Figure 3.6 shows three \\(\\beta_n\\)’s and four \\(\\delta_i\\)’s. The difference between ability of child \\(n\\) and difficulty of item \\(i\\) is \\[\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\] In the special case that \\(\\beta_n = \\delta_i\\), the person will have a probability of 0.5 of passing the item. 4.6.1 Logistic model A widely used method to map differences on the latent scale are logistic units (or logits) (Berkson 1944). In R we can calculate the probability by the inverse-logit (or logistic function) for a difference of 0 and 1 as plogis(c(0, 1)) ## [1] 0.500 0.731 Figure 4.5: Standard logistic curve. Percentage of children passing an item for a given ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). Figure 4.5 shows how the percentage that pass the item varies in terms of the ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). The gap can vary either by \\(\\beta_n\\) or \\(\\delta_i\\), so we may use the graph in two ways: To find the probability of passing various items for a child with ability \\(\\beta_n\\). If \\(\\delta_i = \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\delta_i &lt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\delta_i &gt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). To find the probability of passing a given item \\(\\delta_i\\) for children that vary in ability. If \\(\\beta_n = \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\beta_n &lt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\beta_n &gt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). 4.6.2 Types of item response functions The standard logistic function is by no means the only option to map the relation between the latent variable and the probability of passing an item. The logistic function is the dominant choice in IRT, but it is instructive to study some other mappings. The item response function maps success probability against ability. Figure 4.6: Item response functions for five hypothetical items, each demonstrating a positive relation between ability and probability to pass. Figure 4.6 illustrates several other possibilities. Let us consider five hypothetical items, A-E. Note that the horizontal axis now refers to ability, instead of ability-item gap in 4.5. A: Item A is the logistic function discussed in Section 4.6. B: For item B, the probability of passing is constant at 30 percent. This 30 percent is not related to ability. This item does not measure ability, and only adds to the noise. It is a bad item for measurement. C: Item C is step function centered at an ability level of 1, so all children with an ability below 1 logit fail, and all children with ability above 1 pass. This is the ideal item for discriminating children with an abilities above and below 1. The item is not sensitive to differences at other ability levels, and often not so realistic in practice. D: Like A, item D is a smoothly increasing logistic function, but it has an extra parameter that allows it to vary its slope (or discrimination). The extra parameter can make the curve steeper (more discriminatory) than the red curve, in the limit approaching a step curve. It can also become shallower (less discriminatory) than the red curve (as plotted here), in the limit approaching a constant curve (item B). Thus, item D generalizes items A, B or C. E: Item E is even more general in the sense that it need not be logistic, but a general monotonically increasing function. As plotted, the item is insensitive to abilities between -1 and 0 logits, and more sensitive to abilities between 0 to 2 logits. These are just some examples of how the relation between the child’s ability and passing probability could look. In practice, the curves need not start at 0 percent or end at 100 percent. They could also be U-shaped, of have other non-monotonic forms. See Coombs (1964) for a thorough overview of such models. In practice, most models are restricted to shapes A-D. 4.6.3 Person response functions The roles of persons and items can be switched. The person response function tells us how likely it is that a single person can pass an item, or more commonly, a set of items. Let us continue with items A, C and D from Figure 4.6, and calculate the response function for three children, respectively with abilities \\(\\beta_1 = -2\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0\\) and \\(\\beta_3 = 2\\). Figure 4.7: Person response functions for three children with abilities -2, 0 and +2, using a small test of items A, C and D. Figure 4.7 presents the person response functions from three persons with abilities of -2, 0 and +2 logits. The functions are calculated as the average of response probabilities on items A, C and D. Thus, on average, we expect that child 1 will pass an easy item of difficulty -3 in about 60 percent of the time, whereas for an intermediate item of difficulty of -1 the passing probability would be 10 percent. For child 3, with a higher ability, these probabilities are quite different: 97% and 90%. The substantial drop in the middle of the curve is caused by the step function of item A. References "],
["sec-engelhard.html", "4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement", " 4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement In this work, we strive to achieve invariant measurement, a very strict form of measurements that is subject to the following requirements (Engelhard Jr. (2013), p. 14): Item-invariant measurement of persons: The measurement of persons must be independent of the particular items that happen to be used for the measuring. Non-crossing persons response functions: A more able person must always have a better chance of success on an item that a less able person. Person-invariant calibration of test items: The calibration of the items must be independent of the particular persons used for calibration. Non-crossing item response functions: Any person must have a better chance of success on an easy item than on a more difficult item. Unidimensionality: Items and persons must be simultaneously located on a single underlying latent variable. Three families of IRT models actually support invariant measurement: Scalogram model (Guttman (1950)) Rasch model (Rasch (1960), Andrich (1978), Wright and Masters (1982)) Mokken scaling model (Mokken (1971), Molenaar (1997)) The Guttman and Mokken model yield an ordinal latent scale, while the Rasch model yields an interval scale (with a constant unit).

Interval scale: When it fits, the Rasch model provides an interval scale, the de-facto requirement for any numerical comparisons (c.f. Section 3.3.1). Parsimonious: The Rasch model has one parameter for each item and one parameter for each person. It’s one of the most parsimonious IRT models, and can easily be applied to thousands of items and millions of persons. Specific objectivity: Person and item parameters are mathematically separate entities in the Rasch model. In practice, this means that the estimated difference in ability between two persons does not depend on the difficulty of the test. Also, the estimated differences in difficulties between two items does not depend on the abilities in the calibration sample.

The DDI scores are coded as 0 (FAIL) or 1 (PASS). Since the selection of milestones depends on age, the dataset contains a large number of empty cells. Naive use of sum scores as a proxy to person ability is therefore problematic. An empty cell is not a FAIL, so it’s an error to impute those cells by zeroes. Note that some rows contain only 1’s, e.g., in row 2 or row 10. Many computer program for Rasch analysis routinely remove such perfect scores before fitting. However, unless the number of perfect scores is very small, this is not recommended because doing so can severely affect the distribution of person abilities. In order to effectively handle the missing data and to preserve all persons in the analysis we separate estimation of item difficulties and person abilities into two steps. "],
["sec-itemestimation.html", "5.2 Item parameter estimation", " 5.2 Item parameter estimation There are many methods for estimating the difficulty parameters of the Rasch estimation.

["sec-anchoring.html", "5.3 Anchoring", " 5.3 Anchoring The Rasch model identifies the item difficulties up to a linear transformation. By default, the software produces estimates in the logit scale (c.f. Figure 5.1). The logit scale is inconvenient for two reasons: The logit scale has negative values. Negative values do not have a sensible interpretation in child development, and are likely to introduce errors in practice; Both the zero in the logit scale as well as its variance depend on the sample used to calibrate the item difficulties. The properties of the Rasch model are preserved under a rescaling of the derived scale. In order to make the scale independent of the specified sample, we transform the scale so that two items will always have the same value on the transformed scale. The choice of the two anchor items is essentially arbitrary, but they should correspond to milestones that are easy to measure with small error. In the sequel, we use the two milestones to anchor the scale: Value Item Label 20 ddigmd057 Lifts head to 45 degrees on prone position 40 ddigmd063 Sits in stable position without support This is called the \\(D\\)-score scale. With this choice, \\(D\\)-score values are approximately 0\\(D\\) around birth. At the age of 1 year, the score will around 50\\(D\\), so during the first year of life, one \\(D\\) unit corresponds to approximately a one-week interval.

["sec-dscoreestimation.html", "5.4 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score", " 5.4 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score The \\(D\\)-score quantifies development of a child. In order to calculate the \\(D\\)-score we need the following ingredients: Child’s PASS/FAIL scores on the milestones administered; The difficulty estimates of each milestone administered; A prior distribution, an estimate of the \\(D\\)-score distribution before seeing any PASS/FAIL score. Using these inputs, we may use Bayes theorem to calculate the position of the person on the latent variable. The method is known as the Expected a posteriori (EAP) estimation, and was first described by Bock and Mislevy (1982). 5.4.1 EAP algorithm Calculation of the \\(D\\)-score proceeds item by item. Suppose we have some vague and preliminary idea about the distribution of \\(D\\). The procedure uses Bayes rule to update this prior knowledge with data from the first item (fail/pass score, item difficulty) to calculate the posterior. In the next step, this posterior is used as the prior for the next item, and so on. The procedure stops when all items have been used. The order in which items are entered does not matter for the end result. The \\(D\\)-score is equal to the mean of the last posterior. 5.4.2 Age-dependent starting prior In the first step, we need a starting distribution as prior. The starting prior should define the range of reasonable values for \\(D\\). For example, an infant aged 1 months the \\(D\\)-score will have lower \\(D\\)-score than a child aged 15 months. The prior should be a bit informative but not too much, so it was decided to choose a broad distribution which was centered quite well. The prior was chosen as a normal distribution with a mean equal to the \\(D\\)-score expected at the child’s age, and with a standard deviation of 5, which about twice the normal variation in the \\(D\\)-score. Figure 5.3: Age-dependent starting priors for the D-score at the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months Figure 5.3 illustrates starting distributions (priors) for the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months. As expected, the assumed ability of an infant aged of 1 month is lower than that of a child aged 15 months, which in turn is lower than the ability of a toddler aged 24 months. 5.4.3 Numerical example Suppose we measure two boys aged 15 months, David and Rob, by the DDI. David passes the first four milestones, but does not complete the test. Rob completes the test, but fails on two out of five milestones. Table 5.2: Scores of David and Rob on five milestones from the DDI Item Label Delta David Rob ddifmd011 Puts cube in and out of a box 46.0 1 0 ddifmm012 Plays ‘give and take’ (M; can ask parents) 46.5 1 1 ddicmm037 Uses two words with comprehension 50.1 1 1 ddigmm066 Crawls, abdomen off the floor (M; can ask parents) 46.1 1 1 ddigmm067 Walks while holding onto play-pen or furniture 46.1 0 Table 5.2 shows the difficulties of each milestone and the responses of David and Rob for the standard five DDI milestones for the age of 15 months. The mean \\(D\\)-score for Dutch children aged 15 months is 53.6\\(D\\), so the milestones are easy to pass at this age, with the most difficult being ddicmm037. David passed all milestones, but has no score on the last. Rob fails on ddifmm012 and ddigmm067. How do we calculate the \\(D\\)-score for David and Rob? Figure 5.4: \\(D\\)-score distribution for David and Rob before (prior) and after (posterior) a milestone is taken into account. Figure 5.4 shows how the prior transforms into the posterior after the measurement outcomes is fed into the calculation. There are five milestones, and so calculation is done in five steps: Both David and Rob pass ddifmd011. The prior (light green) is the same as in Figure 5.3. After a PASS, the posterior will be located more to the right, and will often be more peaked. Both happen here, but the change is small. The reason is that a PASS on this milestone is not very informative. For a child with a true \\(D\\)-score of 53\\(D\\), the probability of passing ddifmd011 is equal to 0.966. If passing is so common, there is not much information in the measurement. David passes ddifmm012 but Rob does not. Observe that the prior is identical to the posterior of ddifmd011. For David, the posterior is only slightly different from the prior, for the same reason as above. For Rob, we find a huge change to the left, both in terms of location (from 54.3\\(D\\) to 47.1\\(D\\)) and in terms of peakedness. This one FAIL lowers Rob’s score by 7.2\\(D\\). Milestone ddicmm037 is more difficult than the previous two milestones, so a pass on ddicmm037 does have a clear effect on the posterior for both David and Rob. David’s PASS on ddigmm066 does not bring any additional information, so his prior and posterior are virtually indistinguishable. For Rob, we find a slight effect to the right. There is no measurement for David on ddigmm067, so the prior and posterior are equivalent. For Rob, we observe a FAIL, which shifts his posterior to the left. The \\(D\\)-score is calculated as the mean of the posterior. David’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 55.7\\(D\\). Note that the measurement error, as estimated from the variance of the posterior, is fairly large. Rob’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 47.7\\(D\\), with a much smaller measurement error. This result is consistent with the design principles of the DDI, which is meant to detect children with developmental delay. The example illustrates that the effects of the measurement on the \\(D\\)-score depend on the match between the true (but unknown) \\(D\\)-score of the child and the difficulty of the milestone. 5.4.4 Technical observations on \\(D\\)-score estimation Administration of a very easy set of milestones introduces a ceiling with children that pass all milestones, but whose true \\(D\\)-score could extend well beyond the ceiling. Depending on the goal of the measurement, this may or may not be a problem. The specification of the prior and posterior distributions requires a set of quadrature points at which their densities are calculated. The set of quadrature is taken here as the static and evenly-spaced set of integers between -10 and +80. Using other quadrature points may have a slight effect on the estimate. The actual calculations are here done item by item. A more efficient method is to handle all responses at once. The end result will be the same. References "],

["sec-itemfit.html", "6.1 Item fit", " 6.1 Item fit The philosophy of the Rasch model is different from conventional statistical modeling. It is not the task of the Rasch model to account for the data. Rather it is the task of the data to fit the Rasch model. We saw this distinction before in Section 4.5.2. The goal of model fit assessment is to explore and quantify how well empirical data meet the requirements of the Rasch model. One way to gauge model fit is to compare the observed probability of passing an item to the fitted item response curve for endorsing the item. The fitted item response curve for each item \\(i\\) is modeled as: \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{exp( \\beta_{n} - \\delta_{i})}{1+exp(\\beta_{n}-\\delta_{i})}, \\] where \\(\\beta_n\\) is the ability of person \\(n\\) and \\(\\delta_i\\) is the difficulty of item \\(i\\). It is thus natural to compare the observed and modeled probabilities at various levels of ability. 6.1.1 Well-fitting item response curves Figure 6.1: Empirical and fitted item response curves for two milestones from the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.1 shows the item characteristics curves of two DDI milestones. The orange line represents the empirical probability at different ability levels. The dashed line represents the estimated item response curve according to the Rasch model. The empirical and estimated curves are close together, so both items fit the model very well. 6.1.2 Item response curves showing severe underfit These examples of item response curves fit the model nicely. There are however many cases where things are less bright. Figure 6.2: Three simulated items that illustrate various forms of item misfit. Figure 6.2 shows three forms of severe underfit. The probability to pass item hypgmd001 is almost constant across ability, so retaining this item essentially only adds to the noise. Item hypgmd002 converges to an asymptote around 80 percent and has a severe dip in the middle. The dip is caused by the strong relation to age. Item hypgmd003 appears to have the wrong coding. In addition, the spike-like behavior in the middle is often seen when two or more different items are erroneously given the same code. Removing of items like these could substantially improve model fit. 6.1.3 Item response curves showing overfit Figure 6.3: Two simulated items that illustrate item overfit. Figure 6.3 shows two forms of overfit. The curve of item hypgmd004 is much steeper than the modeled curve. Thus, just this one item is exceptionally well-suited to distinguish children with a \\(D\\)-score below 50 from those with a \\(D\\)-score above 50. Note that the item isn’t sensitive anywhere else on the scale. In general, having items like these is good news, because they allow us to increase the reliability of the instrument. One should make certain though, that FAIL and PASS scores are all measured (not imputed) values. Multiple perfect items could hint to a violation of the local independence assumption (c.f. Section 4.5). Developmental milestones sometimes have combinations of responses that are impossible. For example, one cannot walk without being able to stand, so the inconsistent combination (stand: FAIL, walk: PASS) will not be observed. This leads to more consistent responses that would be expected by chance alone. In principle, one could combine the two such items into one three-category items, which effectively set the probability of inconsistent combinations to zero. Item hypgmd005 is also steep, but has an asymptote around 80 percent. This causes discrepancies between the empirical and modeled curves around the middle of the probability scale. In general, such items could be removed if a sufficient number of better items are available. 6.1.4 Item infit and outfit Item fit can quantified by item infit and outfit. Both are aggregates of the model residuals. The observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) of person \\(n\\) on item \\(i\\) can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). The expected response \\(P_{ni}\\) is modeled as \\[P_{ni} = \\frac{exp(\\hat\\beta_{n} - \\hat\\delta_{i})}{1 + exp(\\hat\\beta_{n} - \\hat\\delta_{i})}\\], where \\(\\hat\\beta_{n}\\) is the estimated ability of person \\(n\\), and where \\(\\hat\\delta_{i}\\) is the estimated difficulty of item \\(i\\). The standardized residual \\(z_{ni}\\) is the difference between the observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) and the expected response \\(P_{ni}\\), divided by the expected binomial standard deviation: \\[z_{ni} = \\frac{x_{ni}-P_{ni}}{\\sqrt{W_{ni}}}\\], where the expected response variance \\(W_{ni}\\) is calculated as \\[W_{ni} = P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})\\]. Item infit is the sum of the squared residuals divided by the sum of the expected response variances \\(W_{ni}\\). \\[\\mathrm{Infit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_n^N W_{ni}}\\] Item outfit is calculated as the average (over \\(N\\) persons) of the squared standardized residual \\[\\mathrm{Outfit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N z_{ni}^2}{N}\\] The expected value of both infit and outfit is equal to 1.0. The interpretation is as follows: If infit and outfit are 1.0, then the item perfectly fit the Rasch model, as in Figure 6.1; If infit and outfit &gt; 1.0, then the item has underfit. The amount of under fit is quantified by infit and outfit, as in 6.2; If infit and outfit &lt; 1.0, then the item fits the model better than expected (overfit). The amount of over fit is quantified by infit and outfit, as in 6.3. Infit is more sensitive to discrepancies in the middle of the probability scale, whereas outfit is the better measure for discrepancies at probabilities close to 0 or 1. Lack of fit is generally easier to spot at the extremes. The two measures are highly correlated. Infit is generally considered more important. Values near 1.0 are desirable. There are no cut-and-dried cutoff values for infit and outfit. In general, we want to remove underfitting items, e.g., item with infits or outfits higher than, say, 1.3. Overfitting items with values lower than 1.0 are not harmful. Preserving these items may actually help to increase reliability of the scale. The cut-off chosen also depends on the number of available items. When there are many items to choose from, we could use a stricter criterion, say infit and outfit &lt; 1.0 to select only the absolutely best items. 6.1.5 Infit and outfit in the DDI Figure 6.4: Frequency distribution of infit (left) and outfit (right) of 57 milestones from the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.4 displays the histogram of the 57 milestones from the DDI (c.f. Section 4.1). Most infits are within the the range 0.6 - 1.1, thus indicating excellent fit. The two milestones with extremely low infits are ddigmd052 and ddigmd053. These two items actually screen for paralysis for newborns, so the data contain hardly any fails on these milestones. The outfit statistics also indicate good fit. "],
["sec-personfit.html", "6.2 Person fit", " 6.2 Person fit The person fit quantifies the extent to which the responses of a given person conform to the Rasch model expectation. The Rasch model expects that a more able person has a greater probability to pass an item than a less able person. Fit analysis evaluates the extend to which this is true. 6.2.1 Person infit and outfit In parallel to item fit, we can calculate person infit and person outfit. Both statistics evaluate how well the responses of the persons are consistent with the model. The outfit statistic is heavily influenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. Outfit is high, for example, when the person fails easy items but passes difficult items. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlaying, on-target, unexpected responses. Similar to item fit, person fit is also calculated from the residuals, but aggregated in a different way. Person infit is calculated as \\[\\mathrm{Infit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^L (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_n^L W_{ni}}\\] and person outfit is \\[\\mathrm{Outfit} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^L z_{ni}^2}{L}\\] As a threshold for person fit &lt; 3.0 can be used to clean out persons with implausible response patterns. 6.2.2 Person infit and outfit in the DDI Figure 6.5: Frequency distribution of person infit (left) and person outfit (right) for 16538 measurements of the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.5 displays the frequency distribution of person infit and person outfit 16538 measurement of the DDI in the SMOCC data. The large majority of the values falls below 3.0. For infit, only 43 out of 16538 measurements (0.3 percent) is above 3.0. For outfit, there are 446 out of 16538 measurement (2.7 percent) above 3.0. Expect the solution to improve after deleting these measurements. "],
["sec-dif.html", "6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF)", " 6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF) 6.3.1 Relevance of DIF for cross-cultural equivalence An important assumption in the Rasch model is that a given item has the same difficulty in different subgroups of respondents. Climbing stairs is an example where this assumption is suspect. The exposure to stairs, and hence the opportunity for a child to practice, varies across different cultures. It could thus be that two children with the same ability but from different cultures have different success probabilities for climbing stairs. When these probabilities systematically vary between subgroup, we say there is Differential Item Functioning, or DIF (Holland and Wainer 1983). DIF is undesirable since it can make the instrument culturally biased. 6.3.2 How to detect DIF? Zumbo (1999) provided a clear definition of DIF: DIF occurs when examinees from different groups show differing probabilities of success on (or endorsing) the item after matching on the underlying ability that the item is intended to measure. There are various ways to detect DIF. Here we will model the probability of endorsing an item by logistic regression using the observed item responses as outcome, and with ability, the grouping variable, and the ability-grouping interaction as predictors. When the latter two terms explain the residual variance of the item scores after adjusting for ability, the item presents DIF for that group. DIF can be visually inspected by plotting the curves for the subgroups separately. The are two forms of DIF: Uniform DIF: The item response curve differ between groups in location, but are parallel; Non-uniform DIF: The item response curve differ between groups in location, in slope and possibly in other characteristics. These forms correspond to, respectively, the main effect of group and the ability-group interaction in the logistic regression model. 6.3.3 Examples of DIF Figure 6.6: Two milestones from the DDI with similar item response curves for boys and girls. There is no DIF for sex. Figure 6.6 shows an example comparing boys and girls. For both milestones, the item response curves are similar for boys and girls, so we see no evidence of DIF here. Figure 6.7: Two milestones from the DDI with different item response curves for boys and girls. There is evidence for uniform DIF. Figure 6.7 displays two milestones with DIF between boys and girls. Milestone ddifmm019 (“Takes off shoes and socks”) is easier for girls by about 0.86 logits (= the difference in ability at the intersection of 50 percent). Conversely, milestone ddigmm064 (“Crawls forward, abdomen on the floor”) is easier for boys by about 0.84 logits. These are the largest differences found for sex in the DDI. Both are primarily uniform DIF. In practice, having milestones with opposite forms of DIF in the same instrument will cancel out one another, so one need not be overly concerned in that case. However, we should be careful when the instrument consists of milestones that all have DIF in the same direction. References "],
["sec-iteminformation.html", "6.4 Item information", " 6.4 Item information 6.4.1 Item information at a given ability Items are generally sensitive to only a part of the ability scale. Item information is a psychometric measure that quantifies how informative the item is at different levels of ability. Item information can be plotted as a curve for each item. Figure 6.8: The item information curve for two milestones from the DDI. Figure 6.8 displays the item information curves for two milestones from the DDI. Note that the amount of information for the item is maximal around the item difficulty. In the Rasch model, the information curves of different items are just translations along the ability scale. The formula to obtain the item information is the first derivative of the item response curve and can be written as follows: \\[I(\\delta)=P_i(\\delta)(1-P_i(\\delta))\\] where \\(P_i(\\delta)\\) is the conditional probability of endorsing an item. For example for milestone ddicmm039 (“Says three words”) the \\(\\delta_i\\) equals \\(4.06\\). The probability of endorsing this item for a person with an ability level of \\(2\\) standard deviation above the mean is \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{\\mathrm{exp}(2 - 4.06)}{1+\\mathrm{exp}(2-4.06)} = 0.113\\] So for an ability level of \\(2\\) standard deviations above the mean \\(\\beta_n = 2\\), milestone ddicmm039 has an information of \\[I(\\delta)=0.113(1-0.113) = 0.1\\] 6.4.2 Item information at a given age In practice, it is often interesting to express the item information against age. By doing so, one can identify at what ages the item provides the most information. Figure 6.9: Information information of Figure 6.8 plotted against age. Figure 6.9 shows that the sensitive age ranges differ considerably between items. Milestone ddigmm060 is sensitive at between ages 10–20 months, where ddicmm039 is sensitive between ages 27–47, a range that is twice as broad. Note also that the information curves are no longer symmetric. The item information by age curve helps to determine at what ages the item can best be administered. The item will be most informative, when administered at the age at which 50% of the children will pass the milestone. Administering the item closely around that age provide the most efficient measurement of ability. When space is at premium (e.g. as in population surveys) using a well-chosen set of age-sensitive milestones will help in reducing the total number of milestones that needs to be measured. In other contexts, milestones may be used as a screening instrument to identify developmental delay. In that case, it is more efficient to administer items that are very easy for the age, e.g. milestones on which, say, 90% of the children will pass. "],
["sec-reliability.html", "6.5 Reliability", " 6.5 Reliability Reliability is defined as the proportion of variance of the person estimates (i.e. abilities) relative to the total variance, including errors. More specifically, the reliability \\(R\\) of a test is written as \\[R \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{\\beta}^2}{\\sigma_{\\beta}^2 + \\sigma_{e}^2},\\] where \\(\\sigma_{\\beta}^2\\) is the variance of true ability and \\(\\sigma_{e}^2\\) is the error variance. Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) is a popular estimate of the lower bound of the reliability of a test. In the Rasch model, we can estimate reliability by the ratio \\[\\hat{R} = \\frac{\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2 - \\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2}{\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2}.\\] For a given model, we can calculate \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2\\) directly as the sampling variance of the estimated abilities, but getting an estimate for \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2\\) is more difficult. We use the modeled abilities and modeled difficulties to generate a hypothetical data set of the same size and same missing data pattern, and re-estimate the abilities from the simulated data. Then \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2\\) is computable as variance of the difference between the modeled abilities and the re-estimated abilities. The estimated variance of the modeled abilities is \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta}^2 = 76.6\\), and the variance of the difference between modeled and re-estimated abilities is equal to \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e}^2 = 1.74\\). The corresponding standard error of measurement (sem) is \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat e} = 1.32\\) logits. The estimated reliability in the SMOCC data can now be calculated as \\((76.6-1.74)/76.6 = 0.977\\). This number can be interpreted in the same way as Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\). The reliability is very high here because of the large variation in \\(D\\)-scores. In practice, the sem is perhaps a more relevant measure of precision. "],

["sec-internal.html", "7.1 Internal validity", " 7.1 Internal validity 7.1.1 Content validity Content validity is the extent to which the D-score represents all facets of development. In contrast to “face validity”, which assesses whether the test appears valid to respondents, content validity is about what is actually measured. One important form of content validity is that we wish to make sure that the measurement scale represents the various developmental domains in a fair way. In the simplest case, we can assign each milestone uniquely to one domain, and evaluate coverage by splitting the cumulative item information over domains. Figure 7.1: Cumulative item information by DDI domain. Figure 7.1 shows how well each of the three domains of the DDI are covered at various levels of the \\(D\\)-score. 7.1.2 Construct validity Construct validity is the extent to which the \\(D\\)-score behaves like the theory says the construct should behave. For example, we expect that child development advances with by age. Figure 4.3 actually confirms that the \\(D\\)-score increases fastest in the first six months and keeps increasing, but slower, as children age. This is consistent with theories in growth and child development. "],
["sec-external.html", "7.2 External validity", " 7.2 External validity 7.2.1 Discriminatory validity With discriminatory validity, we indicate the extend to which the D-score can discriminate respondents that are not developing normally from respondents that are normally developing. This can be evaluated by deviding respondents for who we know that development lags as indicated by another measure, for example reflex and/or tonus problems in a population form Togo (Chapter 8). The D-score should be able to discriminate between these two types of respondents accurately. 7.2.2 Convergent validity Convergent validity is the extend to which the D-score relates to other similar constructs and can be measured as the correlation with other tests that are assumed to measure the same thing. Examples are the total score for Bayley-III or the Denver, which are both instruments to measure early child development. This is similar to concurrent validity. For a good convergent validity the correlation to other construct should be at least 0.6. Unfortunately, only limited data are available for the DDI, so convergent validity for the D-score cannot be assessed at this point. Another option is to evaluate the extend to which the D-score relates to measures that are currently used as a proxy for child development, such as stunting (height) (see section 1.3). 7.2.3 Predictive validity Predictive validity refers to the degree to which the D-score predicts score on a criterion that is measured late in time.

Thus, at the 2-month visit, the \\(D\\)-score was calculated from 2 (standard) + 5 (additional) = 7 milestones. In daily practice, the set of additional milestones is often lacking. This chapter explores the impact of using the (smaller) subset of standard milestones on measurement error and prediction. This section reports and compares three \\(D\\)-scores: \\(D\\)-score from standard milestones; \\(D\\)-score from additional milestones. \\(D\\)-score from all available milestones; Estimation of 1 is more difficult than for 2 and 3, for the following reasons: There are fewer milestones, so the estimate is less precise and more influenced by the choice of the prior distribution; The standard set contains only easy milestones, which are uninformative for the majority of children. 8.2.2 Milestone sets at month 2 Figure 8.2: Distribution of the \\(D\\)-scores calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones at month 2. Colors correspond to the number of fails. The vertical axis of Figure 8.2 shows the \\(D\\)-score, separately calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones for children aged 2 months. The color of the dots represents the number of FAIL scores within each set of milestones. At month 2 there are just two standard milestones: ddicmm030 and ddifmd002. About 90 percent of the infants will pass these. The estimated \\(D\\)-scores corresponding to two passes is represented by the green dots in the left-hand side figure. As explained in Section 5.4.2, the \\(D\\)-score is calculated by using an age-dependent prior. If the ages vary (and they do), then the \\(D\\)-score for infants having the same total score will also vary. If a child fails on either ddicmm030 or ddifmd002, then the \\(D\\)-score is substantially lower. The left-hand figure shows a gap between the green dots (perfect score) and the yellow dots (one FAIL). The impact of a FAIL on the \\(D\\)-score is substantial. For example, the \\(D\\)-score of an infant with one FAIL on a standard milestone drops from about 20\\(D\\) to 14\\(D\\). Thus, with these two milestones there cannot be a \\(D\\)-score in the range 15\\(D\\) - 18\\(D\\). It depends on the purposes of the measurement whether this is acceptable. We can prevent such gaps by measuring more milestones, e.g., milestones taken from the additional set. Another gap occurs between 14\\(D\\) and 11\\(D\\). These gaps illustrate that precision is constrained when only two milestones are administered. The middle figure shows the estimated \\(D\\)-score at the same visit, but now calculated from the five additional milestones (i.e., the standard milestones from month 3). Infant aged 2 months have approximately a 50 percent chance of passing each. Note that administration of the additional milestones will cover the range 14\\(D\\)-20\\(D\\) quite well. Note the ceiling is also higher with these milestones. Note that the range of the estimated \\(D\\)-scores is quite similar in both plots. This is because \\(D\\)-score estimation takes the difficulty level of milestones into account. The estimate of the \\(D\\)-score is unbiased for difficulty. 8.2.3 Milestone sets at month 3 Figure 8.3: Distribution of the \\(D\\)-scores calculated from the standard, additional and all available milestones at month 3. Colors correspond to the number of fails. Figure 8.3 is the same plot as before, but now for month 3. Compared to Figure 8.2 all points shifted upwards, as a consequence that the children are now one month older. The additional milestones from month 2 are the standard milestones of month 3. In Figure 8.2 there were at least 11 children (in purple) failed all five additional milestones. One month later, there is one child having five fails. 8.2.4 Floor and ceiling effects Figure 8.4: \\(D\\)-score by age 0-30 months for standard, additional and all available milestones at each measurement occasion. Figure 8.4 plot the \\(D\\)-score distribution for all occasions. Some observations: Ceiling effect: The ceiling effect (green) is most prominent in the standard set, but is also present in the other two sets. None of the three sets is able to filter out children with really advanced development. In order to achieve more precision at the upper end, we would need to include more difficult milestones. Floor effect: There are almost no floor effects in the standard and all sets. These sets discriminate well among children with delayed development, which was the design purpose of the DDI. Floor effects visible in the additional set. Average level: All three sets capture the overall relation between age and development. The additional set is quite efficient for measuring average levels development, but lacks detail on the extremes. Figure 8.4 shows that a short test (5-6 milestones) can precisely measure the lower tail of the \\(D\\)-score distribution (standard set) or the middle of the \\(D\\)-score distribution (additional set), but cannot do both at the same time.

If we want to identify children at risk for delayed development, we are interested in the lower tail of the distribution, so in that case the standard set is suitable. But what set should we use if we want to predict a later outcome? This section explores that effect of taking different milestone sets on the quality of prediction. 8.3.2 UKKI Hafkamp-de Groen et al. (2009) studied the effect of the \\(D\\)-score on later intelligence, using a subset of 557 SMOCC children that were followed up at the age of five years. Intelligence was measured by the Utrechtse Korte Kleuter Intelligentietest (UKKI) (Baarda 1978). The UKKI is a simple test with just three components: Redraw five figures (square, triangle, cross, trapezoid, rhomboid); Draw human figure, with 28 characteristics, like legs, eyes, and so on; Give meaning to 13 words like knife, banana, umbrella, and so on. Administration time is about 15-20 minutes. The UKKI has a reasonable test-retest reliability for group use (Pearson \\(r = 0.74\\), 3-month interval). 8.3.3 Exploratory analysis Figure 8.5: Histogram of UKKI IQ scores taken around the age of five years (SMOCC data, \\(n = 557\\)). Figure 8.5 shows the empirical IQ distribution of 557 children. The mean IQ score is 108 and the standard deviation is 15, so the IQ-scores of children in the sample is about a half standard deviation above the 1978 reference sample. Figure 8.6: Relation between \\(D\\)-score at infancy and IQ at age 5 according to three milestone sets and nine visit (SMOCC data, \\(n = 557\\)). Figure 8.6 shows that the relation between the \\(D\\)-score 0-2 years and IQ at 5 years is positive for all milestone sets and for all ages. The strength of the relation increases with age. At the age of 2 years, the regression coefficient for \\(D\\)-score is equal to \\(\\beta(D) = 1.4\\) (SE: \\(0.21, p &lt; 0.0001\\)), so on average an increase of 1.0 unit in the \\(D\\)-score at the age of 2 years corresponds to a 1.4 IQ-score points increase at the age 5 years. Table 8.2: Pearson correlation between D-score (0-2 years) and IQ at 5 years Visit Standard set Additional set All milestones 1m 0.058 0.010 0.033 2m 0.043 0.054 0.043 3m 0.034 0.100 0.101 6m 0.041 0.038 0.036 9m 0.095 0.143 0.132 12m 0.049 0.159 0.135 15m 0.193 0.155 0.197 18m 0.137 0.150 0.153 24m 0.245 0.254 0.272 Table 8.2 summarizes the Pearson correlations between the \\(D\\)-score and later IQ. The association between \\(D\\)-score and IQ is weak during the first year of life, but gets stronger during the second year. In general, having more (and more informative) milestones helps to increase the correlation, but the effect are relatively small. So even from the standard set of the seven easy milestones at 24m we obtain a reasonable correlation of 0.245. All in all, these results suggest that neither the amount nor the difficulty level of the milestones are critical in determining the strength of the relation between the \\(D\\)-score and IQ.

["pops-study.html", "9.2 POPS study", " 9.2 POPS study Figure 9.2: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score and DAZ by child age in a cohort of preterm aged 0-2 years. Ages are corrected for preterm birth by a factor of 0.75 (Source: POPS data, \\(n = 450\\), 4 occasions). Figure 9.2 presents the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ distributions for the POPS cohort of children born very preterm or with very low birth weight. All in all, the distributions of the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ are similar to those found in the SMOCC study. Since the \\(D\\)-scores are calculated using the same milestones and difficulty estimates as used in the SMOCC data, the \\(D\\)-scores are comparable across the two studies. The primary new complication here is the question whether it is fair compare postnatal age (or calender age) of children born a term with calender ages of very preterm children. This section focuses on this issue in some detail. 9.2.1 POPS design In 1983, the Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants (POPS study) collected data on all 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth (gestational age &lt; 32 weeks) or very low birth weight (birth weight &lt; 1500 grams). See S. P. Verloove-Vanhorick et al. (1986) for details. Gestational age was determined from the best obstetric estimate, including last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. The POPS study collected measurements on 450 children using the DDI at four visits at corrected postnatal ages of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. 9.2.2 Age-adjustment Assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause over-diagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children. Very preterm children may require additional time to enable development equivalent to that of normal term birth children. In anthropometry, it is common to correct chronological age of very preterm born children so as to enable age-appropriate evaluation of growth. For example, suppose the child is born as a gestational age of 30 weeks, which is 10 weeks early. A full correction would deduct 10 weeks from the child’s postnatal age, and a half correction would deduct 5 weeks. More in particular, we calculate corrected age (in days) as: \\[ \\mathrm{corrected\\ age} = \\mathrm{postnatal\\ age}\\mathrm{\\ (days)} - f \\times [280 - \\mathrm{gestational\\ age\\ (days)}], \\] where we specify several alternative for \\(f\\) as 1.00 (full correction), 0.75, 0.50 (half) or 0.00 (no correction). Let’s apply the same idea to child development. Using corrected age instead of postnatal age has two consequences: It will affect the prior distribution for calculating the \\(D\\)-score; It will affect DAZ calculation. We evaluate these two effects in turn. 9.2.3 Effect of age-adjustment on the \\(D\\)-score Figure 9.3: Scatterplot of two versions of the \\(D\\)-score, one calculated using calender age (\\(f = 0.00\\)), the other calculated using full age-adjustment (\\(f = 1.00\\)). Figure 9.3 plots the fully age-adjusted \\(D\\)-score against the unadjusted \\(D\\)-score. Any discrepancies result only from differences in the ages used in the age-dependent prior (c.f. Section 5.4.2). The effect of age-adjustment on the \\(D\\)-score is always in the same direction, and only sizable for perfect scores, especially for lower \\(D\\)-scores. Discrepancies are tiny for non-perfect scores. 9.2.4 Effect of no age adjustment (\\(f = 0.00\\)) on the DAZ Figure 9.4: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score and DAZ without age correction for preterm birth (\\(f = 0.00\\)). Figure 9.4 illustrates that a considerable number of \\(D\\)-scores fall below the minus -2 SD line of the reference when age is not adjusted, especially during the first year of life. The pattern suggests that the apparent slowness in development is primarily the result of being born early, and does not necessarily reflect delayed development. 9.2.5 Effect of full age adjustment (\\(f = 1.00\\)) on the DAZ Figure 9.5: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score and DAZ under full age correction for preterm birth (\\(f = 1.00\\)). Full age correction has a major effect on the DAZ. Figure 9.5 illustrates that the POPS children are now somewhat advanced over the reference children. This may reflect the effect of longer exposure to sound and vision ex-utero, so developed in preterms may actually be more advanced than that of term peers. Full age correction overcorrects the \\(D\\)-score, so it is natural to try intermediate values for \\(f\\) between 0 and 1. 9.2.6 Partial age adjustment Table 9.1: Average DAZ at various ages under four correction factors. Month 0.00 0.50 0.75 1.00 [0.493,2.99] -1.461 -0.499 0.072 0.734 (2.99,4.58] -1.775 -0.888 -0.375 0.200 (4.58,6] -1.601 -0.872 -0.457 -0.003 (6,8.34] -1.760 -1.129 -0.774 -0.385 (8.34,12] -1.205 -0.767 -0.531 -0.282 (12,15.2] -0.990 -0.597 -0.386 -0.162 (15.2,24] -0.495 -0.235 -0.100 0.038 (24,32.5] -0.704 -0.486 -0.365 -0.243 Table 9.1 compares mean DAZ under various specifications for \\(f\\). Values \\(f = 0.00\\) and \\(f = 0.50\\) do not correct for preterm birth enough in the sense that all sign are negative. In contrast, \\(f = 1.00\\) overcorrects as a value of 0.59 is implausibly high. Setting \\(f = 0.75\\) seems a good compromise. The average DAZ is close to zero in the first age interval. The fact that average DAZ is negative at later ages under \\(f = 0.75\\) may be reflect less than optimal growth and development of very preterm and low birth weight children. 9.2.7 Conclusions Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age 5 months when chronological age was fully corrected; Fewer preterm children reached the milestones when chronological age was not corrected; Fewer children reached the milestones when \\(f = 0.50\\) correction was used; Similar proportions were observed when \\(f = 0.75\\) was used within the first 5 months after birth. After chronological age 5 months, similar proportions were observed between very preterm and full term children when chronological age was fully corrected. We recommend the \\(f = 0.75\\) correction of chronological age. References "],

Figure 9.6 presents the \\(D\\)-score and DAZ distributions of a sample of children living near Kpalimé, Togo. While the main trend with age conforms to the previous data, the distributions differ from those in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 in two respects: Compression at upper end: Most of the \\(D\\)-scores are above the median curve, which suggests that, at these ages, children living in Togo develop faster than children living in the Netherlands; Expansion at lower end: There is a huge variation in \\(D\\)-scores on the lower end, with many \\(D\\)-scores below the -2 SD curve, suggesting that some children are significantly more delayed than would be expected in both Dutch samples. The \\(D\\)-scores are calculated using the same 57 milestones and difficulty estimates as before. The resulting \\(D\\)-score distribution is quite unusual. The main question here is what could explain the pattern found in the \\(D\\)-scores. This section explores this question in some detail. 9.3.1 Togo Kpalimé study, design If the \\(D\\)-score is to be a universal measure, then it should be informative in low and middle income countries (LMIC) as well. Not much is yet known about the usability and validity of the \\(D\\)-score in LMIC’s. The western African country of Togo definitely qualifies as a low income country, with a 2017 GNI per capita of USD 610 (c.f. USD 46,180 in the Netherlands), and USD 744 for low income countries in general (data.worldbank.org). The data were collected by Cécile Schat-Savy, who initiated a youth health care center modeled after the Dutch youth health care system in Kpalimé, Togo. See https://www.kinderhulp-togo.nl for background. Data monitoring included a french translation the DDI for measuring child development. Data were gathered from about 9747 individuals in the 0-18 age range. Participants include children and their parents who visited the Kpalimé health center at least one time. Kpalimé is the fourth biggest town in Togo, but the health center also attracted parents and children from a wide surrounding rural area. Parents visited the health center for several reasons, including for a preventive health check or because of their child’s apparent health problems. The possibility of visiting the health center was advertised to parents through information sessions for parents at primary schools. Parents paid a small amount of money per visiting child (about USD 4.00 for children of 4 years or older, and USD 0.80 for children younger than 4 years). All data were registered in paper dossiers. Data were digitized by four local data-assistants, and on a regular basis mailed to TNO, the Netherlands to check for completeness and consistency. Figure 9.7: Three of the data-assistants who helped to digitize the paper files. Here we use a subset of 2674 visits from 1644 unique children who were scored on the 57 milestones of the DDI 0-2 years. \\(D\\)-scores could not be calculated when either age or DDI data were missing, which leaves a dataset of 2425 visits from 1567 children. The number of visits that parents of these children in the 0-4 age range paid to the health center varied from 1 – 9, but the majority of children were seen once. 9.3.2 \\(D\\)-scores labelled by neurological problem Figure 9.8: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by neurological (tonus and/or reflex) problems. (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.8 is the same scatter plot as in Figure 9.6, but now marked by whether the physician registered signs of neuropathology in the form of tonus and reflex problems. Many children with low \\(D\\)-scores also tonus and/or reflex problems. This finding alone suggests that extreme \\(D\\)-score are not artifacts (e.g. caused by a wrongly coded age), but actually indicate major adverse health conditions. 9.3.3 \\(D\\)-scores labelled by Apgar score Figure 9.9: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by Apgar score (10 minutes) lower than 8. (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.9 identifies the children who had an Apgar score at 10 minutes after birth that was lower than 8. About half of these children had a \\(D\\)-score below -2 SD curve. 9.3.4 \\(D\\)-scores labelled by severe underweight Figure 9.10: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by severe underweight (WAZ &lt; -4) (Source: TOGO data). Many children who visited the Kpalimé health center had a low body weight for their age. Figure 9.10 marks the subset of severely underweight children (WAZ &lt; -4). A substantial proportion of these children also had a very low \\(D\\)-score. 9.3.5 \\(D\\)-scores labelled by severe stunting Figure 9.11: Distribution of \\(D\\)-score by age labelled by severe stunting (HAZ &lt; -4) (Source: TOGO data). Figure 9.11 is similar to 9.10, but now marked by the subset of severely stunted children (HAZ &lt; -4). Also, here a sizable proportion has a low \\(D\\)-score. When taken together, Figures 9.8-9.11 show that children with very low \\(D\\)-scores often experience (multiple) harsh health problems. Those health problems may have substantially delayed their development. 9.3.6 Gross motor development Figure 9.12: Gross motor milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.12 shows large differences in gross motor development between children from Togo and from the Netherlands. For example, at the age of three months, about 30 percent of the Dutch infants succeed in controlling their head when pulled to sitting. However, infants from Togo are already capable to control their head when they are just one month old! Moreover, the advantage persists at least until up to the age of two years: children in Togo can roll over and sit much earlier, or kick a ball without falling. As the documentary Babies shows, African children even manage to learn to walk with a tin can on their head, a craft that not many westerners can dream of. 9.3.7 Fine motor development Figure 9.13: Fine motor milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.13 shows a less pronounced but similar phenomenon for fine motor skills. These data suggest that children in Togo have generally better fine motor skills than the children from two Dutch cohorts. 9.3.8 Communication and language Figure 9.14: Communication and language milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones. Figure 9.14 summarizes the data for three milestones on communication and langauge. In general, the success probability is similar in the three studies. One curious finding is that the high proportion of milestones passes in ddicmm041 for the Togo children around the age of 18 months. Note that several of the green lines in Figures 9.12-9.14 start off close to perfect scores, which makes is impossible to show the rising patterns found in the Dutch data. It may be indeed be true that children from Togo develop more rapidly than Dutch children. It would be desirable if these results could be backed up from other sources. "],
["conclusions-1.html", "9.4 Conclusions", " 9.4 Conclusions This chapter compared the \\(D\\)-scores estimated from the DDI administered to three different groups of children. We found that The \\(D\\)-score by age plot showed postive, curved relation with age in all three studies; Children born very preterm and/or with very low birth weight had similar development to reference children when their age was corrected for early birth; A relatively small subset of children born in Togo had extremely low \\(D\\)-scores, not found in the Netherlands, likely the result of underlying neuropathology, severe underweight and/or severe stunting; On average, children from Togo seemed to faster development during the first two years, especially in motor development. All in all, these findings support the usefulness and validity of the \\(D\\)-score as an informative summary of generic development of children during their first two years of life. "],

["usefulness-of-d-score-for-monitoring-child-health.html", "10.1 Usefulness of \\(D\\)-score for monitoring child health", " 10.1 Usefulness of \\(D\\)-score for monitoring child health 10.1.1 A scale for child development The \\(D\\)-score is a new approach to measure child development. The \\(D\\)-score is a scale for quantifying generic child development by a single number. The \\(D\\)-score fits the Rasch model. The measurements can therefore be interpreted as scores on an interval scale, a requirement for answering questions like: What is the difference in development over time for the same child, group or population? What is the difference in development between different children, groups or populations of the same age? How does child development compare to a norm? The \\(D\\)-score is not tied to a particular instrument. Any instrument that fits the model underlying the \\(D\\)-score can be used to measure the child’s \\(D\\)-score. The precision of the measurement depends on the number of milestones used, as well as on the match between the difficulty of the milestones and the ability level of the measured child. The measurement instrument can thus be tailored to the question at hand. 10.1.2 A growth chart for child development The field of child growth and development roughly divides into two areas: The subfield child growth (or auxology) emphasizes body measures like height, weight, body mass index, and so on. It is a rigorous quantitative science with intimate ties to statistics since the days of Quetelet and Galton. The subfield child development is more recent and builds upon a wide-ranging set of domain-specific instruments for measuring motor, language, cognitive and behavioral states. The growth chart is a widely used tool to monitor physical growth. The \\(D\\)-score can be used in a similar way to create the \\(D\\)-chart. Figure 9.15: \\(D\\)-chart with five children from the SMOCC study. Figure 9.15 shows developmental trajectories of five randomly chosen children from the SMOCC study. Note that the trajectory can be created even though the milestones are different at different ages. The trajectory may help to track development of a child on a periodic basis. The \\(D\\)-chart shows that it is straightforward to apply quantitative techniques from child growth to child development. Our hope is that \\(D\\)-score aids in bridging the somewhat disparate subfields of child growth and child development. "],
["opportunities-for-early-intervention.html", "10.2 Opportunities for early intervention", " 10.2 Opportunities for early intervention Black et al. (2017) estimated that about 250 million children worldwide fail to reach their developmental potential. Developmental delays become evident in the first year, and worsen during early childhood. The burden of children not reaching their developmental potential is high. Interventions aimed at improving child development should be delivered at the sensitive periods for maximum effect. Programs are to be comprehensive, incorporating a combination of health, nutrition, security and safety, responsive caregiving and early learning. See Engle et al. (2011) and Grantham‐McGregor et al. (2014) for recent overviews. Both estimation of intervention effects as well as comparison across different treatments is hampered by the absence of universal measure for child development. The lack of a common yardstick may have adverse impact on proper policy and priority setting. Since the \\(D\\)-score is not tied to a particular instrument, our hope is that it may help in improving decision making, ultimately lowering the number of children not reaching their developmental potential.
