["sec-definitions.html", "2.1 What is child development?", " 2.1 What is child development? In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies in the field (Shirley 1931) was executed under the explicit aim … that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously. Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these domains of development. Figure 2.1: Gross motor development as a sequence of milestones. Source: Shirley (1933). Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure 2.1 illustrates the various stages needed for going from a fetal posture to walking alone. The ages are indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in timing between infants. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development: Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in an orderly sequence. Gesell’s definition emphasizes that development is a continuous process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves. Liebert, Poulos, and Strauss (1974) (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon that unfolds in isolation. Development refers to a process in growth and capability over time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with the environment. Cameron and Bogin (2012) (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows: “Growth” is defined as an increase in size, while “maturity” or “development” is an increase in functional ability…The endpoint of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate successfully … not just biological maturity but also behavioral and perhaps social maturity. Berk (2011) (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on child development as follows: Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions, each representing a different skill area that may undergo both continuous and stagewise transformation. There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given here just illustrate the main points of view in the field. References "],
["sec-theories.html", "2.2 Theories of child development", " 2.2 Theories of child development The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g. Santrock (2011), Berk (2011)), or by searching for the topic of interest in an encyclopedia (e.g. Salkind (2002)). The introductions by Santrock (2011) and Berk (2011) both distinguish major theories in child development according to how each answers to following three questions: 2.2.1 Continuous or discontinuous? Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring from one stage to another? Many stage-based theories of human development have been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by Erikson (Erikson 1963), Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (Kohlberg 1984) and Piaget’s cognitive development theory (Piaget and Inhelder 1969). Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout childhood. The first period, the sensimotor period (approximately 0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these six stages describe “the road to conceptual thought”. Piaget’s stages are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism in intellectual development. On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a continuous process. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) says: A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on. 2.2.2 One course or many? Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the work of Gesell. The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion, so there may be multiple ways to reach the same point. Figure 2.2 illustrates that the path taken by a given child will depend on the child’s unique combination of personal and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in development. Figure 2.2: A representation of the dynamic systems viewpoint on how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point using different paths. Source: Berk (2011). 2.2.3 Nature or nurture? Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question how to explain individual differences. Maturation usually defined as the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that differences in development are innate and stable over time, but that there may be differences in speed. Others argue that individual differences are primarily driven by environmental factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child development. The answer — if there is one — in this stability-versus-plasticity debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that differences are natural and stable, then it may not make sense trying to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to be small. On the other hand, if we view development as plastic, then improving the environment may have substantial pay-offs in terms of improved development. References "],

Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of the baby’s walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room, and lightly greases the soles of the baby’s feet with olive oil. The baby was invited to “walk” on the sheet. Of course, very young infants need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were repeated every week or bi-weekly. Table 2.1: Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) for 21 babies (Shirley 1931, Appendix 8).

Table 2.1 lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark in the first column the babies were already stepping when the observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she could walk alone. 2.3.2 Individual trajectories of motor development Figure 2.3: Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Figure 2.3 is a visual representation of the information in Table 2.1. Each data point is the age of first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs, there is a jump to the next level. The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry) or who jump over stages (Martin, Max). For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no sensible interpretation. We might be inclined to think that the vertical distance portrays to how difficult it is to achieve the next stage, but this is inaccurate. Instead, difficulty of passing from one stage to the next corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction between stages. For example, on average the line for stepping is rather short in all plots, so going from stepping to standing is relatively easy. The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher. Shirley (1931) actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure 2.3 plot only the 76 visits that showed a jump. In order to obtain individual curves like these, the data collection needs to be intense and costly. Fortunately, there are alternatives that are much more efficient. References "],

["sec-agebased.html", "3.1 Age-based measurement of development", " 3.1 Age-based measurement of development 3.1.1 Motivation for age-based measurement The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to describe the behavior expected at a selected age. Gesell (1943) (p. 89) formulates this goal as follows: We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age. There is a large literature that quantifies development in terms of ages at which the child is expected to show a specific behavior. For example, in Shirley’s motor data in Table 2.1, we may summarize the ages at which each of the 21 children enters a given stage. Figure 3.1: Ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. 3.1.2 Age equivalent as difficulty Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of a given developmental milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of the age at which children achieve it. For example, Stott (1967) (p. 25) defines the age equivalent and its use for measurement, as follows: The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age at which children reach that particular stage. Figure 3.2: Boxplot and mean (symbol x) of the ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. Figure 3.2 adds boxplot and the mean age at which the children enter the four stages. The difficulty of the stages can thus be expressed as age equivalents: 16.1 weeks for stepping, 27.2 weeks for standing, 43.3 weeks for walking with help and 63.3 weeks for walking alone. Alternatives to the mean age equivalent include the ages at which 10, 50 or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of reasoning has led to the widely used concept of developmental age as a measure of a child’s development (in body size or motor skill or psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms. 3.1.3 Limitations of age-based measurement Age-based measurement is easy to understand, but is not without some pitfalls: Age-based measurement can inform us whether a child is earlier or later for a given milestone. However, it does not tell us what behaviors are characteristic for a child of a given age. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there is no norms, we cannot quantify development. Age-based measurement intertwines quantification of development with evaluation of development. Age-based measurement only works at the item level, and is cumbersome to apply with multiple items. References "],
["sec-scorebased.html", "3.2 Score-based measurement of development", " 3.2 Score-based measurement of development A second approach to measurement is to administer multiple items to the child, and and compute the total number of PASS responses as a measure of child’s development. Items can be ordered in difficulty, so one may skip items that are too easy, and stop when items become too difficult. Since different children get different sets of items, one cannot simply interpret the sum score of a measure of development. Most instruments describe corrections that should be applied, typically under the assumption that the child would have passed all “too easy” items and failed on all “too difficult” items. This procedure is typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor, cognitive, and so on. Score-based measurement is the dominant approach, but is not without conceptual and logistical issues. The total scores calculated by different instruments are based on different sets of items, and hence cannot be compared. In addition, instruments use their own age norms, but these do extend to norms for measurements made by other instruments. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive items tap into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The materials are often proprietary and sometimes costly. "],
["sec-unitbased.html", "3.3 Unit-based measurement of development", " 3.3 Unit-based measurement of development Unit-based measurement starts from the premise that the measurement scale must have a constant unit. If that holds, then the same difference between two values has the same interpretation anywhere on the scale. Familiar examples of such scales includes temperature and dates. For example, the difference between two dates corresponds to the same amount of time, irrespective of whether this is now, in the past or in the future. The interval scale has a fixed unit and an arbitrary zero. In the ideal situation, we would have a unit for child development. Let us name this unit D, for development. Unit D should have the following desirable properties: Difference between two D-scores measured on the same child at different ages quantifies the amount of development during the interval Difference between the D-score measured on two different children of the same age quantifies the difference in development between them Comparing the D-score to an age-dependent reference identifies abnormal development The interpretation of the difference between two D-score is the same across the entire scale, just like differences in height or weight. Note that the unit would allow us to answer all questions raised in section @(sec:questions). The development of a unit for development is still in its infancy. However, if we succeed in creating an interval scale for development, then an enormous arsenal of technique developed for quantitative variables opens up to measure, track and analyze child development.

Age-based measurement expresses development in age-equivalents, whose precise definition depends on the reference population. Score-based measurement quantifies development by summing the number of passes, but different instruments make different selections of items, so the measurements are unique to the instruments, and cannot be compared across instruments. Neither approach provides a unit for child development. In order to make progress, what we need is the definition of a unit for child developent, and an operationalization how each measurement item related to the unit. If we success in this, we are able to construct different instruments that yields measurement in a common metric. The next chapter will introduce the basic concepts for this new approach. "],

["measurement-through-latent-variables.html", "4.1 Measurement through latent variables", " 4.1 Measurement through latent variables In this booklet we define measurement as the process of locating children and items on a line. This line can represents a latent variable, a continuous construct that defines the different poles of the concept that we want to measure. In our case, the concept is child development. Other constructs, like height, temperature or happiness would be equally valid constructs. A latent variable ranges from low to high. A latent variable cannot be measured directly. It is a theoretical construct. Figure 4.1: Placing items and children onto the same line reveals their positions. Figure 4.1 shows the imaginary positions on a gross-motor continuum of three babies from Figure 2.1 at the age of 30 weeks. Note that both items and children are ordered along the continuum. Thus, standing is more difficult than stepping, and at week 30, Doris was more developed than Walley. Although the latent variable cannot be measured directlty, we may be able to actually measure variables (i.e., score test items) that are in some way related to the latent variable. For example, we may have the child’s scores on a set of tasks, such as “stacking two blocks” or “standing”. The measured data are related to the latent variables by means of the measurement model. See 4.2 for more detail on such models. In practice, the position of the items on the line will be fixed at the time that the measurement instrument is created. Application of the instrument involves placing children onto the line given their scores on one or more of the items. This activity is the act of measuring, which is probably the more common interpretation of the word measurement. Realize however that measurement always requires positioning both the items and the persons, though not necessarily at the same. "],
["sec-measurementmodel.html", "4.2 Measurement model", " 4.2 Measurement model Uni-dimensional measurement models attempt to explain systematic patterns in the observed data through their relation to a single underlying variable. For example, we may find that the observed data are highly correlated, but that this correlation disappears within groups of children that have the same value on the latent variable. In that case, we have absorbed the common information in the variables into a single score that captures the relevant information. It may be that the measurement model does not fit the data sufficiently well. There are various strategies how to deal with this issue. We may extend the measurement model so that it will be able to extract additional features from the data. Alternatively, we may search for a subset of the data (usually the items) that does fit the model. These are very different strategies that have led to heated debates among psychometricians. See Engelhard Jr. (2013) for an overview. Most measurement models used today are probabilistic. These models express the probability of passing an item as a function of the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty. A person with low ability will almost surely fail a difficult item, whereas a highly able person will almost surely pass an easy item. One may also use the model to compare persons or items.

["sec-logit.html", "4.3 Logit scale", " 4.3 Logit scale Let us now introduce a few symbols. We adopt the notation used in Wright and Masters (1982). See Chapter 12 for a complete list. Let \\(\\beta_n\\) be the true (but unknown) developmental score of a child at the time of measurement. The more generic term for \\(\\beta_n\\) is the child’s ability. Let \\(\\delta_i\\) be the true (but unknown) difficulty of an item. Thus, Figure 4.1 shows three \\(\\beta_n\\)’s and four \\(\\delta_i\\)’s. Differences on the latent scale are commonly expressed as “logistic units”, or logits (Berkson 1944). If the person ability \\(\\beta_n\\) and the item difficulty \\(\\delta_i\\) coincide, then the ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i = 0\\), and the person has an probability of 0.5 of passing the item. In R we can calculate this probability by the inverse-logit (or logistic function) as plogis(0) ## [1] 0.5 Likewise, if \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i = 1\\), then person ability is larger than item difficulty, and we find a higher the probability of passing: plogis(1) ## [1] 0.731 Figure 4.2: Standard logistic curve. Percentage of children passing an item for a given ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). Figure 4.2 shows how the percentage that pass the item varies in terms of the ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). The gap can vary either by \\(\\beta_n\\) or \\(\\delta_i\\), so we may use the graph in two ways: To find the probability of passing various items for a child with ability \\(\\beta_n\\). If \\(\\delta_i = \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\delta_i &lt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\delta_i &gt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). To find the probability of passing a given item \\(\\delta_i\\) for children that vary in ability. If \\(\\beta_n = delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\beta_n &lt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\beta_n &gt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). 4.3.1 Item response functions The standard logistic function is by no means the only possibility to model the relation between the latent variable and the probability of passing an item. The item response function of an item describes the probability of passing the item at each ability level. Figure 4.3: Item response functions for five hypothetical items, each demonstrating a positive relation between ability and probability to pass. Figure 4.3 illustrates several other possibilities. Let us consider five hypothetical items, A-E. Note that the horizontal axis now refers to ability, instead of ability-item gap in 4.2. A: Item A is the logistic function discussed in Section 4.3. B: For item B, the probability of passing is constant at 30 percent. This 30 percent is not related to ability. This item does not measure ability, and only adds to the noise. It is a bad item for measurement. C: Item C is step function centered at an ability level of 1, so all children with an ability below 1 logit fail, and all children with ability above 1 pass. This is the ideal item for discriminating children with an abilities above and below 1. The item is not sensitive to differences at other ability levels, and often not so realistic in practice. D: Like A, item D is a smoothly increasing logistic function, but it has an extra parameter that allows it to vary its slope (or discrimination). The extra parameter can make the curve steeper (more discriminatory) than the red curve, in the limit approaching a step curve. It can also become shallower (less discriminatory) than the red curve (as plotted here), in the limit approaching a constant curve (item B). Thus, item D generalizes items A, B or C. E: Item E is even more general in the sense that it need not be logistic, but a general monotonically increasing function. As plotted, the item is insensitive to abilities between -1 and 0 logits, and more sensitive to abilities between 0 to 2 logits. These are just some examples of how the relation between the child’s ability and passing probability could look. In practice, the curves need not start at 0 percent or end at 100 percent. They could also be U-shaped, of have other non-monotonic forms. See Coombs (1964) for a thorough overview of such models. However, most models are restricted to shapes A-D. 4.3.2 we know the score on one or more items, and the difficulties of these items, we may calculate the position of the person on the latent variable. 4.3.3 Criteria for invariant measurement Here we assume that the latent variable has a constant unit, so interpretation of the same difference is identical across the entire scale. Measurement is the process of assigning numbers by rules to a set of persons or objects. This definition is a little liberal. In order to be useful the process of assigning numbers must be bound by some imperatives. In this booklet, we strive to achieve invariant measurement, a very strict form of measurements that is subject to the following requirements (Engelhard Jr. (2013), p. 14): Item-invariant measurement of persons: The measurement of persons must be independent of the particular items that happen to be used for the measuring. Non-crossing persons response functions: A more able person must always have a better chance of success on an item that a less able person. Person-invariant calibration of test items: The calibration of the items must be independent of the particular persons used for calibration. Non-crossing item response functions: Any person must have a better chance of success on an easy item than on a more difficult item. Unidimensionality: Items and persons must be simultaneously located on a single underlying latent variable. A statistical model that conforms to these five requirements is said to be an ideal-type model. There are only very few ideal-type models. An ideal-type model isn’t changed to fit the data, but the data (items and persons) are selected to fit the ideal-type model. The need for the five requirements for invariance is not universally shared. In particular, a substantial group of statisticians questions the need for requirements 2 and 4, especially the words “always” and “any”, and may opt for more flexible models that do not strictly adhere to the invariance conditions 2 and 4. There are also more flexible models that assume a multi-dimensional instead of a unidimensional latent variable. Some investigators question all requirements, and would rather not be restricted and place a high value to a good fit to all data. 4.3.4 Person response functions We now switch the roles of persons and items, and construct a function that tells us how likely it is that a single person can pass an item, or more commonly, a set of items. Let us continue with items A, C and D from Figure 4.3, and calculate the response function for three children, respectively with abilities \\(\\beta_1 = -2\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0\\) and \\(\\beta_3 = 2\\). Figure 4.4: Person response functions for three children with abilities -2, 0 and +2, using a small test of items A, C and D. Figure @ref{fig:prfplot} presents the person response functions from three persons with abilities of -2, 0 and +2 logits. The functions are calculated as the average of response probabilities on items A, C and D. Thus, on average, we expect that child 1 will pass an easy item of difficulty -3 in about 60 percent of the time, whereas for an intermediate item of difficulty of -1 the passing probility would be 10 percent. For child 3, with a higher ability, these probabilities are quite different: 97% and 90%. The substantial drop in the middle of the curve is caused by the step function of item A. Requirement 2 states that the success probability should be higher for persons with a higher ability level. This is indeed the case here, but there are also item response functions for which requirement 2 does not hold. 4.3.5 What is a test? A set of items forms a test. The primary reason for administering a test rather than a separate item is to improve the precision of the measurement. The scores on the set of items (rather than the score on a single item) can be combined into an overall score. Of course, combining scores can only make sense if these items measure the same underlying construct. In principle, the five items A-E in Figure 4.3 could form a test. This would not be an ideal test though, since this test would violate requirement 4. We know that the difficulty of item A is equal to +1 logits, and the difficulty of item C is 0 logits, so item C is easier than item A. Requirement 4 says that persons should have a higher chance of passing C. This is true indeed for persons having an ability lower than +1 logits. However, for a person with ability +2 logits, the probability of passing A is higher than passing C, hence requirement 4 does not hold for any test that holds both items A and C. 4.3.6 Interval scale The important property is that \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) are all on the same scale, and hence can be compared in a sensible way. In particular, suppose that \\(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 = \\beta_3 - \\beta_2\\), we might say that the difference between ability \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) is the same the difference between abilities \\(\\beta_2 - \\beta_3\\). This is the essential property of an interval scale. 4.3.7 Family of item response theory models Ideal-type models: Guttman scalogram model (Guttman (1950)) Rasch model (Rasch (1960)) and extensions (Wright and Masters (1982), Andrich (1988)) Mokken scaling model (Mokken (1971)). The Guttman and Mokken model yield an ordinal latent scale, while the Rasch model yields an interval scale (with a constant unit). References "],

For example, Drachler, Marshall, and De Carvalho Leite (2007) formulated the model as a logistic regression model on the logarithm of age: \\[ \\ln \\frac{P(Y_j=1)}{P(Y_j=0)} = \\alpha_j + \\beta_j\\ln X \\] For this model, the age at which 50% of the children pass item \\(j\\) can be calculated as to \\(\\exp(-\\alpha_j/\\beta_j)\\). Since older children are expected to be more mature, this parameter is typically interpreted as the difficulty of the item. The slope parameter \\(\\beta_j\\) indicates how rapidly the probability of passing rises with age. Items with high \\(\\beta_j\\) have a great power to discriminate developmental status well within a small age range. It is straightforward to calculate any other age-percentiles, for example, the ages at which probabilities 10% or 90% of the sample pass the item. Table~2 in Drachler, Marshall, and De Carvalho Leite (2007) reports these statistics for the Denver developmental test. While the idea of breaking up the test into separate items is productive, age-based measurement has severe weaknesses. The concepts of age and development are not separated, so we cannot interpret the difficulty of an item without age. It would be more convenient, and conceptually clearer, if item difficulty could be a free-standing concept. The models are fitted separately for each \\(Y_j\\). Nothing is specified how the items relate to each other, so in principle, any variable that changes with age (e.g. child had first birthday) could qualify as a developmental item. It would be better of the procedure would start from a model about how the items should relate to each other. The intercept and slope estimates are dependent on the sample. A sample consisting of children of low ability would give different estimates than a sample of children with high ability. Calibration of test items is not person-invariant. It would be preferable if the difficulty estimates were independent of the sample used to estimate them. Because of the introduction of slopes in the logistic model a more able person may have a lower success probability for some items than a less able person. It would be preferable if more able persons have a better succes rate on all items. In general, we expect that this probability increases with ability (requirement 2). Note that this formulation differs from that given in Section 3.1, where the probability was said to increase in age, not ability. We will address this crucial difference in more detail in Section xx. References "],

["the-dutch-development-instrument-ddi.html", "5.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI)", " 5.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) In the Netherlands, development of children is monitored by using the Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI; in Dutch: Van Wiechenschema). The DDI consists of 76 items and a subset of these items are assessed at different ages, ranging from 1 month to 4.5 years old. To explain how the D-score is calculated and demonstrate the use of the D-score package two example children, both of the age of 15 months, are used. One of the example children is able to do all items of his/her age, and the other example child is not able to do all items of his/her age. In this way, we can show how different scores on a item affect the D-score. So for example, for a child of the age of 15 months the Dutch Developmental Instrument consists of the following six items: puts cube in and out of a box, plays ‘give and take’, crawls (abdomen off the floor), walks along, understands a few words, and says 2 ‘sound-words’ with comprehension. For each of these six items it is noted whether the child was able to perform this item. An example of the results can be found in table 4.1, in which child 1 was able to perform all items and child 2 was able to perform four of the six items. Based on these scores we can calculate the dscore for both these children. Table 4.1: Example of scores on the items of the DDI at the age of 15 months age in years item 1 item 2 item 3 item 4 item 5 item 6 child 1 1.25 1 1 1 1 1 1 child 2 1.25 1 0 1 1 1 0 Calculation of the D-score is an iterative procedure, in which in each step information of one item is added. The iterative procedure uses Bayes rule to update the prior (knowledge) with data to calculate a posterior. In the next step, this posterior is used as the prior and information, the score, from a new item is added. This results in a new posterior distribution. When the information of all items have been added to the procedure, the D-score is equal to the mean of the final posterior distribution. !!plafond prior nog uitleggen!! In the first step, the score of the first item is combined with the prior. However, at the first step we cannot use the previous posterior as our prior. Hence, we need a starting distribution to use as the prior in the first step. It is important that this starting distribution is a bit informative but not too much, so it was decided to choose a quite broad distribution which was centred quite well. The prior was chosen in such a way that the mean value of the prior distribution was equal to the median D-score at that age. The standard deviation is equal to 5, which about twice the normal variation in the D-score. The starting distributions (priors) for the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months are given in figure 4.5. This figure shows that the priors assume that ability of a child of the age of 1 month is lower than the ability of a child of the age of 15 months, which in turn is lower than the ability of a child of the age of 24 months. Figure 4.5: Priors at ages of 1, 15 and 24 months First, it is important that the names of the items used are similar to the names of the items in the built-in item bank. In this example the lexicon gcdg is used. Moreover, the data should be in long format with the following columnnames: items, scores and ages. This leads to table 4.2. Table 4.2: Long format of the example of scores on the items of the DDI at the age of 15 months child items scores ages child 1 n32 1 1.25 child 1 n33 1 1.25 child 1 v38 1 1.25 child 1 n37 1 1.25 child 1 n34 1 1.25 child 1 n35 1 1.25 child 2 n32 1 1.25 child 2 n33 0 1.25 child 2 v38 1 1.25 child 2 n37 1 1.25 child 2 n34 1 1.25 child 2 n35 0 1.25 Now that the data is in long format and the item names are changed to the lexicon gcdg, we can calculate the D-score for both children. In the first step of the iterative procedure, we combine the age-dependent prior of 15 months with the score of the first item n34 to define the posterior. Item n34 is a gross motor item: ‘crawls, abdomen off the floor’. In table 4.2, we can see that both example children were able to crawl with their abdomen off the floor. Note, that we could have chosen any of the items as the first item, since the D-score is independent of the order of items in the calculation. The age dependent prior of 15 months and the posterior distribution after adding information from item n34 are given in figure 4.6. In this figure, we can see that the posterior distribution doesnot differ that much from the prior distribution. Both distributions are centred at the same point, while the posterior distribution is smaller than the prior distribution indicating more precision. Since both example children were able to crawl with their abdomen off the floor, the posterior distribution after the first step of the procedure is equal. Figure 4.6: Age-dependent priors of 15 months and posterior after 1st item n34 Now, let’s add an item on which the scores for the two example children differ, e.g. item n35. Item n35 is also a gross motor item, namely ‘walks along’. So both children are able to crawl (with their abdomen of the floor), but only child 1 is able to walk along. We can use the previously calculated posterior distribution as prior when we add item n35. Let’s start with child 1, who is able to walk along. Using Bayes rule, the new posterior distribution can be calculated. In figure 4.7 the prior, in this case the posterior after adding item n34 to the age-dependent prior, and the newly calculated posterior distribution are visualized. Again, the posterior and prior are centred around the same point, while the posterior has a bit more precision. Figure 4.7: Prior and posterior in the 2nd step of the iterative process for child 1 Now we can do the same thing for child 2, who is able to crawl with his/her abdomen off the floor (n34) but not to walk along (n35). Again, we can use the posterior after adding information from n34 as the prior and use the information from n35 to calculate the posterior. In figure 4.8 the prior and posterior are given. Now the prior and posterior are different, the posterior is on the left of the prior and has an high precision in comparison to the prior. Hence, being unable to walk along at the age of 15 months, like child 2, is more indicative for the development of a child of 15 months than being able to walk along like child 1. Figure 4.8: Prior and posterior in the 2nd step of the iterative process for child 2 The next four steps in the iterative procedure, information from the other four items (n32, n33, v38 and n37) can be added in a similar fashion. Figure 4.9 shows the final posterior distributions for child 1 and child 2 and the prior distribution for the age of 15 months. The D-score can now be determined by looking at the mean of the posterior distributions. Hence, the D-score for child 1 and child 2 are equal to 55.75 and 47.76, respectively. Figure 4.9: Prior and final posterior for child 1 and 2 ## 1.25 ## 55.7 ## 1.25 ## 47.8 nog toe te voegen in de tekst quadratic points Note: met deze methode is het mogelijk om scores voor extremen te berekenen, andere methodes (zoals de worms estimator) kunnen dit niet altijd. Prior die gekozen was: plafond prior (wanneer je alle items kan) We already explained how the D-score suffers from a ceiling and bottom at the start and end of the scale. However, this can also happen within the D-score scale: some values of the D-score will never occur no matter the combination of scores on the milestones. This will mainly occur when calibrated milestones are used to calculate the D-score. For example, the Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI), which is used as a screening instrument, is calibrated: at each wave 90% of the children should be able to get a positive score on the milestones. Which allows for detection of children with a developmental delay. "],

Accordingly, the model fit determines how well emprirical data meets the requirement of the Rasch model. The fit of the data to a Rasch model can be visually inspected by comparing the observed probability of endorsing an item to the fitted item response curve for endorsing the item.

An assumption of the Rasch model is that items with a lower difficulty will always have a higher probability to pass in comparison to items with a higher difficulty level. Fit analysis evaluates the extend to which this is true for each item. Two types of item fit are distinguished: the item outfit and the item infit. The outfit evaluates the extent to which the responses to the items are consistent with the model. In other words wheter items with a lower difficulty also have a higher probability to pass. The outfit statistic is heavity infulenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlying, on-target, unexpected responses.

["different-item-functioning-dif.html", "6.4 Different item functioning (DIF)", " 6.4 Different item functioning (DIF) An important aspect of item fit to the Rasch model is the assumption that items have the same difficulty in different subgroups of respondents, which is called Differential Item Functioning (DIF). Zumbo (1999) describes a clear definition: “DIF occurs when examinees from different groups show differing probabilities of success on (or endorsing) the item after matching on the underlying ability that the item is intended to measure.” (Zumbo 1999) The examination of DIF can be done by modelling the probability of endorsing an item in a logistic regression model by the ability from the Rasch model and a grouping variable. When the grouping variable significantly explains residual variance of the item scores after adjusting for the ability, the item presents DIF for that group. head(sm1$beta_l) ## country study id wave age n b ## 1 NL Netherlands 1 10001 1 0.0833 5 -17.07 ## 2 NL Netherlands 1 10001 2 0.1583 2 -11.91 ## 3 NL Netherlands 1 10001 3 0.2583 11 -8.58 ## 4 NL Netherlands 1 10001 4 0.5000 13 -4.72 ## 5 NL Netherlands 1 10001 5 0.7500 8 -1.99 ## 6 NL Netherlands 1 10001 6 1.0000 8 1.86 #make dataframe with covariates, b, and pass References "],

Of this cohort, general characteristics and developmental milestones of the Dutch Development Instrument at 2y of age (range 22-26 months) were available for 1,578 children. During the SMOCC study the milestones of the current wave and the next wave were assessed (Herngreen et al. 1994). With the SMOCC dataset we can compare the D-scores calculated by making use of calibrated milestones (the current wave milestones) with the D-scores calculated by making use of non-calibrated milestones (the next wave milestones). These D-scores for children of the age of 2 and 3 months (wave 2 and 3) are plotted against IQ at 5 years in figure 8.1. The continuous variable IQ at 5 years allows for nice visualization of the variation in D-scores. Moreover, the densities of the D-score are given at the bottom of the plots showing the distribution of the values of the D-score. Figure 8.1: Comparison of the D-scores calculated by calibrated and non-calibrated milestones at the age of 2 months (Wave 2) and 3 months (Wave 3) The colours of the dots in figure 8.1 indicate the number of negative scores on the milestones: note that the number of milestones can differ per wave. Wave 2 has two milestones, Wave 3 has five milestones and Wave 4 has six milestones of the DDI. The variation in the D-score of the children with the same number of negative scores (the same colour of dots) is caused by variation in age. Since the D-score is calculated by using an age-dependent prior, younger children in the same wave with the same scores will have a lower D-score. Moreover, the plots on the left in figure 8.1 show that using calibrated milestones leads to a gap between the green dots (zero negative scores) and the yellow dots (one negative score). Since 90% of the children should be able to get a positive score on each of the milestones implies that the milestones should be quite easy for the children of that age. So, when a child gets a negative score, it should have an impact on the D-score. For example, when a child of the age of 2 months has one negative score, his/her D-score immediately drops from around 20 to around 14. Which implicates that if you use the 2 month milestones for a child of the age of 2 months he/she will never have a D-score in the range of 15 - 18. This shows that it is also possible to have a ceiling/bottom within the D-score scale. This would be ideal in screening purposes, were you want to find children that have a delay in their development in comparison to their peers. In addition, the plots on the right in figure 8.1, show the D-scores when non-calibrated milestones (the milestones of the next wave) are used. For the DDI, on average, around 50% of the children should be able to get a positive score in this situation. For example, 50% of the children of the age of 2 months should be able to get a positive score on the 3 month milestones. Since these milestones are considered to be more difficult, a negative score on one of the milestones will have a smaller effect on the D-score. Hence, the gap we saw before between the green and yellow dots disappears. Furthermore, there is more variation in the D-scores and the ceiling/bottom within the D-score scale disappears. Previously described phenomena are also visible in the densities of the D-scores. When the D-scores are calculated with the calibrated milestones, the left plots in figure 8.1, the density consists (at least) of two (small) peaks. While the D-scores calculated with non-calibrated milestones, the plots on the right, show a broader variation in the values of the D-score. Note, that the density of the D-score in the plot on the bottom right also shows the bottom effect of the D-score: the D-score is at least equal to 20.

Developmental milestones can be assessed at several chronological ages (defined as age since birth, or postnatal age) to identify very preterm children who have developmental delay and who would benefit from stimulation programs. However, assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause overdiagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children and excessive referral for stimulation programs. Very preterm children may require additional time, determined by a factor that considers the difference between gestational age at birth (\\(GA_{birth}\\)) vs 40 wk (\\(GA_{birth}\\) for normal term birth), to enable development equivalent to that of normal term birth children. Several authors have proposed full or half correction of chronological age of very preterm birth children to provide a realistic evaluation of age-appropriate milestones; e.g. compare milestones for a child born at \\(GA_{birth}\\) 30 wk vs a normal term child when the chronological age is 10 (full correction, i.e. 40 minus 30 wk) or 5 wk (half correction, i.e. 40 minus 35 wk) lower for the term than very preterm child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) – a modification of the Gesell test – is used in preventive child health care to assess development from birth to chronological age 4 y. Data In 1983, data were collected for 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth (\\(GA_{birth} \\geq\\) 25 and &lt; 32 wk) or very low birth weight (birth weight &lt; 1500 g) (Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants [POPS]). Methods The \\(GA_{birth}\\) was determined from the best obstetric estimate, including last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. We evaluated development from birth to chronological age 2.5 y in 258 children who had very preterm birth (&lt;32 wk) and no handicaps such as retardation (3 or 4 months retarded or Developmental Quotient between 80 and 90), neurologic disorder, visual or hearing defects, or psychosocial problems. For the calculation of DAZ, the uncorrected and several corrected chronological ages were used according to the equation: Corrected chronological age (\\(d\\)) = uncorrected chronological age (\\(d\\)) - (\\(X_i × 7 × [40 - GA_{birth}(wk)]\\)) where the correction factor \\(X_i\\) ranged from full (\\(X_i = 1\\)) through half (\\(X_i = 0.5\\)) and no correction (\\(X_i = 0\\)). Development was considered equal to the general Dutch population when mean DAZ = 0. Results Mean DAZ \\(\\pm\\) SD for chronological age with correction by \\(X_i = 1.0\\) were: Uncorrected chronological age 19-26 wk: \\(0.67 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 32-40 wk: \\(-0.1 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 59-66 wk: \\(-0.1 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 111-119 wk: \\(0.1 \\pm 1\\). Mean DAZ \\(\\pm\\) SD for chronological age with correction by \\(X_i = 0.75\\) was: Uncorrected chronological age 19-26 wk: \\(-0.1 \\pm 1\\). Mean DAZ \\(\\pm\\) SD for chronological age with no correction (\\(X_i = 0\\)) were: Uncorrected chronological age 19-26 wk: \\(-1.8 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 32-40 wk: \\(-1.9 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 59-66 wk: \\(-1.1 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 111-119 wk: \\(-0.4 \\pm 1\\). Conclusions Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age 26 wk when chronological age was fully corrected, and fewer preterm children reached the milestones when uncorrected chronological age was used; fewer children reached the milestones when 0.5 correction for \\(GA_{birth}\\) was used, and similar proportions were observed when 0.75 correction for \\(GA_{birth}\\) was used within the first 26 weeks after birth. After chronological age 26 wk, similar proportions were observed between very preterm and full term children when chronological age was fully corrected for \\(GA_{birth}\\). We recommend 0.75 correction of chronological age before uncorrected chronological age 26 wk and full correction for uncorrected chronological age 26 to 119 wk. Impact of characteristics on the DAZ in preterm children Data When we select the DAZ at 2y of fully corrected chronological age (range 22-26 months) within the POPS study, 199 children were available.

There is ample research indicating that the D-score actually is a valid indicator of development in western European countries like the Netherlands. If the D-score is a universal measure it should be informative in low and middle income countries as well. However, little is known about the usability and validity of the D-score in such countries. The aim of the present study is to examine the usability and validity of the D-score in the western African country of Togo. Togo definitely qualifies as a low income country with a 2017 GNI per capita of $610 versus $46,180 in the Netherlands, and $744 for low income countries in general (data.worldbank.org). To address this issue, we used data that were gathered by a French physician in Kpalimé, Togo. She set up a child health care system that was modeled after the Dutch preventive health care system. The system included the use of the so called Van Wiechen system to assess whether children’s developmental progress is in the normal range. The Van Wiechen data were used to calculate the D-scores as well as the age-corrected z-score of the D-score relative to a Dutch sample (DAZ). These two indices are the dependent variables in the present study. Data were gathered from about 9747 individuals in the 0-18 age range, but for the present study we focus on data from children in the 0-4 age range because the Van Wiechen assessment system is meant for this age range. Other available measures include father’s level of schooling, father’s number of children at the child’s first visit to the medical center, the APGAR score as a newborn, children’s weight, and the results of a physician’s neurological examination during visits to the health center. These variables are used to predict children’s D-scores and thereby to examine the D-score’s usability and validity in Togo. Methods Participants Participants potentially included 1859 children in the 0-4 age range who paid at least one visit to the Kpalimé health center. Kpalimé is the fourth biggest town in Togo, but the health center also attracted parents and children from a wide surrounding rural area. Parents visited the health center for several reasons, including for a preventive health check or because of their child’s apparent health problems. The possibility of visiting the health center was made known to parents by information sessions for parents at primary schools. Parents paid a small amount of money per visiting child (about €4 for children of 4 years or older, and €0.80 for children younger than 4 years). Because of limitations that are inherent to working in a low income country (limited access to the internet, computer failure) data of newly digitalized paper dossiers were sent to the Netherlands on a regular basis, but this practice unavoidably caused some unclarities and inconsistencies in the resulting dataset. Many of these could be solved, but time constraints prevented us from solving them all. Consequently, the data of .. potential participants (..%) were not yet included in the present study which leaves a dataset of 1659 (of 1644 NOG UITZOEKEN). Moreover D-scores could not be calculated when either age or Van Wiechen data were missing, which leaves a dataset of 2342 visits from 1522 children. The number of visits that parents of these children in the 0-4 age range paid to the health center varied from 1 – 9, but the majority of children were seen only once (n = 1146; 75.3%). Measures D-score D-scores were calculated based on a French-language version of the Van Wiechen assessment. As in the Dutch preventive health care system, the goal of administering the Van Wiechen assessment was to distinguish children with developmental problems from normal children. This means that items were chosen such that 90% of the children is expected to pass on age-equivalent items. Generally, for children that did not pass items age-equivalent items, extra items meant for a lower age were assessed (with the exception that items meant for children younger than 15 months were never administered to children of age 15 months or older). Scores were strictly based on observations rather than on parent report. For the exact procedure to calculate d-scores based on Van Wiechen-scores, see chapter .. Medical assessment At each visit a physician notated whether problems were observed regarding a wide renage of health aspects including problems with reflexes and muscle tension. Also, weight was measured at each visit. Background characteristics At the first visit of each child, the accompanying adult (mostly the mother) was asked to report on general background characteristics, including profession of the parents and the number of children each of the parents has (due to polygamy this number may differ between parents). As a measure of socio-economic status (SES) we constructed a dichotomous variable ‘schooling of father’ based on the reported profession of the father. As the main physician and founder of the medical center is familiar with the local culture and schooling system, she indicated which of the thirteen most common professions were likely to be schooled professions (i.e. need more than primary education). Fathers with one of these professions were classified as ‘schooled’. When ‘another profession’ was marked, the father was categorized as unschooled. Other background characteristics included gender of the child, number of children of the father at the moment of the first visit, and birth date. Age of the child at the moment of visiting was calculated based on the date of visit and the birth date. In Togo, medical information about a newborn is notated on a special card which parents receive. Parents were asked to take this card to the medical center; in this way information about the birth situation of part of the children was obtained, including birth weight, gestational age (&lt;37 weeks versus 37 weeks or more) and APGAR scores at 1, 5 and 10 minutes after birth. Procedure Measures used in this study were assessed at the medical center in Kpalimé which parents visited with their children, and were part of a general preventive health assessment (including physical measurements of weight, height, and head size, a medical examination, a few blood tests, and a hearing test). Also, parents were asked to report on characteristics of the birth situation, previous health issues, nutrition situation, and background characteristics of the family. During the visits, medical assessment took place before assessment of the Van Wiechen assessment, and was conducted by the same physician. All assessments, including the Van Wiechen assessment, were either performed by the initiating physician and founder of the medical center, or by one of three local physicians trained to assess the Van Wiechen procedure. Resulting data of the assessment (including advice given and/or references to another professional) were documented in paper dossiers and in 2017 digitalized by four local assistants via software program EpiData. Analyses To assess the validity of the D-score in this population, we inspected scatterplots in which d-scores are plotted against age for all available visits, and in which children with neurological problems as observed by a physician are highlighted. It was expected that a curve is seen, with higher d-scores for older children, moreover children with very low D-scores for their age were expected to be assessed by the physician as having a neurological problem. Validity and usability of the D-score in this population would also be supported when known risk factors of developmental problems would be found to be predictors of a lower D-score in this population as well. Risk factors of interest are health problems of a newborn (as indicated by a less than optimal APGAR score at 10 minutes), and being underweighted. Furthermore, if a relation between underweight and a lower D-score is observed, it would also be interesting to see whether there is a relation between family size and D-score, as many children per family could be a cause of malnutrition. For this purpose children were classified as being part of a large family when the number of children of their father was 5 or more (at the moment of their first visit) versus 4 or less. To assess which risk factors predict a lower than normal D-score, several regression analyses were conducted. Outcome variable is the Development - Age adjusted Z-score (DAZ) which tells how many standard deviations the D-score of the child deviates from his/her age mates. To calculate these z-scores, data of Dutch children are used as reference data. As this reference data is only available for children younger than age 2.78 years, only DAZ-scores could be calculated for age group 0 – 2.78, and therefore all regression analyses were performed for this subgroup. For some of the risk factor variables data is only available for part of the children. In order to prevent a loss of power, for each risk factor separate regression analyses were conducted. In each regression sex and education level of father (schooled versus unschooled) were added as covariates (except for the regression where the relation between large families and the DAZ is analyzed, as family size and schooling may be confounded). As data from visits of the same children are not independent, regressions were performed on data with one visit per child only. All regression analyses were conducted twice: once with the data from the first visit of each child, and once with the last visit of each child.

As expected, a curve is seen, with higher ages related to higher D-scores. Also, it can be seen that several D-scores are below the curve, i.e. these children had lower D-scores than their age mates. In figure .. it can be seen that many of these lower than normal D-scores are not artefacts of the data, but belong to children that were observed to have reflex and/or tonus problems. In figure .. underweighted children are highlighted. Visually there seems to be a relation between being underweighted and having a lower than normal D-score. A regression based on data of children&#39;s last visit showed that indeed the age-corrected weight z-score, after correction for fathers&#39; schooling and sex of the child, did predict the DAZ: a decrease of 1 SD in age-corrected weight was related to a decrease of `r round(regr10.3.weight_WHOz.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],1) ` SD in age-corrected D-score (p `r format.pval(regr10.3.weight_WHOz.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001) `), which is a reasonable effect. The overall model explained `r round(regr10.3.summary$adj.r.squared * 100,0)`% of the DAZ variance (adjusted R^2^). As in the other regression analyses sex and fathers&#39; schooling did not contribute significantly to the model. Because there clearly seems to be a relation between underweight and a lower than normal D-score, it was also tested whether family size (which might be a cause of malnutrition) did predict the DAZ. No such relation was found: children from large families (5 or more children of the father at the moment of the first visit versus 4 or less children) did not have different DAZ-scores at their last visit than children from smaller families (after correction for sex: B = `r round(regr6.2.no_of_children_father_dich5.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],2)`, p = `r format.pval(regr6.2.no_of_children_father_dich5.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001, digits=2)`, adjusted R^2^ = `r round(regr6.2.summary$adj.r.squared,3)`). &lt;!-- NOG CHECKEN: is het inderdaad 2zijdig getoetst? --&gt; In figure .. 1070 D-scores of 534 children for who a 10-minute APGAR score was available are shown. A less than optimal 10-minute APGAR score (i.e. less than 10 points) did predict a lower DAZ at their last visit after correction for sex and father&#39;s schooling (B = `r format(round(regr2.3.APGAR10min_dich10.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],2), nsmall=2)`, p `r format.pval(regr2.3.APGAR10min_dich10.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001, digits=2)`, adjusted R^2^ = `r round(regr2.3.summary$adj.r.squared,3)`). So, children with a less than optimal APGAR score at ten minutes after birth, had somewhat lower D-scores. &lt;!-- NOG CHECKEN: waarom is df zoveel kleiner dan 534?

Discussion and conclusions In this study we examined the validity and usability of the D-score in low income country Togo. The D-score does seem to be informative in this country. The D-score did increase with age, and for the majority of the children D-scores were very similar within their age group. It is notable that there were also several children with much lower D-scores when compared with their age mates. This does not seem to be an artifact of the data or of the measures as the majority of these children were observed to have tonus and/or reflex problems. So, it is plausible that these children indeed had developmental problems. Furthermore, health factors that were expected to be related to having a lower D-score were found to be significant predictors: a less than optimal APGAR score 10 minutes after birth, and a lower than normal weight at the time of the assessment were related to a lower than normal D-score. Especially the relation between weight and D-score was quite strong, as the model with age-corrected weight, sex and father’s schooling explained 18% of the variance in age-corrected D-score. The positive relation between weight and D-score, as well as the fact that children were often underweighted in this population, seems to indicate that being underweighted is a risk factor for developmental problems. The main physician of the medical center noted that not many children with extreme underweight were seen, but our results do indicate that also less than severe underweight does have a negative impact on the development of children. The idea that having many children in the family would be related to having a lower D-score (due to possible malnutrition), was not supported. This might mean that there is no clear relation between living in a large family and being underweighted, or that we did not have enough power to detect this, as there were not that many children from large families. Neither sex nor father’s schooling did significantly contribute to variance in age-corrected D-scores. For sex at this young ages, this is consistent with results found in other studies (… refs…). Parents’ schooling has been found to be related to D-scores in other studies (… refs..), that it was not in the present study might have to do with the population, or with the current method where it was estimated whether the parent was schooled based on profession. Many fathers had a profession other than the thirteen most common professions and were estimated to have no schooling, which might not be correct for part of this group. A limitation of the present study is that our sample might not be representative of children in a low income country, or even of children in Togo. Especially the fact that many children came to the medical center because they were ill might mean that they are not representative in terms of general development and other measures. However, the current goal was to examine the validity and usability of the D-score in a low income country, and the result that, even though many children were ill, the D-score is clearly related to neurological problems (as indicated by reflex, and/or tonus problems), age, APGAR score as a newborn and weight does show that the D-score ís informative in a low income country as well. Evt nog doen: - Na overleg met Cécile Schat: zij zagen heel weinig echte ondervoeding; wel is lichaamsbouw daar zeer tenger; wat gebeurt er als je ipv ondergewicht ‘voedingstoestand geobserveerd door arts’ neemt als predictor? Betere indicator van ondervoeding is bovendien: specifieke vorm van bloedarmoede; die variabele zit er ook in; zegt ook iets over eenzijdig eten in plaats van simpelweg te weinig (volgens Cécile Schat komt eenzijdig wel veel voor; te weinig niet) - Gestational age en gebgewicht variabelen naar juiste dataset overhevelen zodat die ook gebruikt kunnen worden (GEDAAN; gebruiken om te laten zien dat verband APGAR-score niet verklaard wordt door prematuriteit?)

["predictive-power-of-d-score.html", "10.3 Predictive power of D-score", " 10.3 Predictive power of D-score To demonstrate the predictive power of the D-score, we will predict IQ at the age of 5 years for children in the SMOCC dataset. We have data for nine different waves, which includes different numbers of milestones of the Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI). See table 10.1 for an overview. Table 10.1: Overview of the nine waves of the SMOCC data Age in months Number of milestones of the DDI wave 1 1 5 wave 2 2 2 wave 3 3 5 wave 4 6 6 wave 5 9 7 wave 6 12 6 wave 7 15 6 wave 8 18 6 wave 9 24 6 First, we will plot the D-scores against IQ at 5 years for each of the waves (see figure 10.1). In this way, we can see the variation in D-scores for the different waves and how this relates to IQ at the age of 5 years. The colours indicate the number of milestones that got a negative score. Thus, for example, yellow indicates that one of the milestones got a negative score, however this does not mean that all yellow dots in the same plot represent the same number of positive scores. It could be that for some children not all scores of the milestones were available. The same holds, ofcourse, for the other colours as well. Figure 10.1: The D-scores plotted against IQ at 5 years for each wave In addition, it is important to note that the number of milestones per wave differ. For example, when we compare the plots for wave 8 and wave 9, it seems that at wave 8 the milestones are more difficult, since there are children who got a negative score on more than one milestone. While at wave 9, the maximum number of milestones with a negative score is one (yellow dots). However, wave 8 contains six milestones of the DDI, while wave 9 only contains one milestone of the DDI. Hence, the difference between the number of milestones at each wave causes the variation in the number of colours used between the nine plots. Furthermore, we can see that there is a gap between the cloud of blue dots and the cloud of yellow dots in all nine plots. Or in other words, there is a substantial difference in D-score between children without negative scores and childeren with (at least) one negative score on the milestone(s) of the DDI. The rational behind this, was explained in Chapter 8. For most of the waves there is no clear relation between the D-score and IQ at 5 years visible in the plots. However, for wave 7 and 9, we can see that the cloud of blue dots (with higher D-scores) lies a bit higher than the cloud consisting of the other dots. This could indicate that children with an higher D-score at the age of 15 months and 24 months also have an higher IQ at the age of 5 years on average. Besides the graphical exploration of the relation between the D-score and IQ at 5 years old, we can also use models to determine this relationship. For example, we can model IQ at 5 years old for each wave separately, which allows us to compare the effect of the D-score at each wave on the variation in IQ at 5 years. First, we can estimate models in which the D-score is the only explanatory variable for the variation in IQ at 5 years. The estimate for the D-score and the \\(R^2\\) of these nine models are visualized in figure 10.2. Figure 10.2: The estimate for the D-score and \\(R^2\\) plotted for each wave In figure 10.2, we can see that the estimates for the D-score and the \\(R^2\\) are the highest for wave 7 and wave 9. Indicating that the D-score at wave 7 and wave 9 has the largest effect on IQ at 5 years and explain the most variation in IQ at 5 years. In addition, figure 10.2 shows that the D-score of the first four waves barely explains any variation in IQ at 5 years. Thus, the D-scores of the first six months is not capable of explaining the variation in IQ at 5 years. Hence, the D-score when the children are older is better in explaining the variation in IQ at 5 years. Secondly, we can add explanatory variables to the regression model to control for confounding effects. For example, the education level of the mother can also partly explain the variation in IQ at 5 years, so it is important to add these to your prediction model. To predict IQ at 5 years, the following explanatory variables are added to the regression model: gender birthweight birthsize agemom: age mother edumocat: low, middle or high education level of the mother age D-score The first five variables are constant over the waves, while the other two variables vary over time. For each wave we have estimated two models, model 1 including all variables as listed above, and model 2 including all variables except for the D-score. Then, we can compare the explained variation of IQ at 5 years old of both models by comparing the adjusted \\(R^2\\). We have chosen for the adjusted \\(R^2\\) since it corrects for the number of variables added to the model: the \\(R^2\\) will always get higher when a new variable is added to the model. In this way, we can see how much of the variation in IQ is explained by adding the D-score to the regression model for each wave. The estimates for the predictor D-score, and it’s 95% confidence interval are given in table 10.2. Moreover, it contains the p-values for the predictor D-score in model 1 and the adjusted \\(R^2\\)’s for model 1 and model 2. The adjusted \\(R^2\\) determines the explained variation in the outcome measure, in this case IQ at 5 years, while penalizing for the number of predictors in the model. Comparison of the \\(R^2\\) is not feasible, since it will always increase when another predictor is added to the model.

In other words, the D-scores until the age of 1 year will not explain the variation in IQ at the age of 5 years. However, for wave 7, at the age of 15 months, the estimate for the D-score is just significant and explains almost 3% of the variation in IQ at the age of 5 years. There is also an almost significant effect of the D-score on IQ at waves 8 and 9, however this only explains around 0.5% of the variation in IQ at 5 years. "],
