["sec-definitions.html", "2.1 What is child development?", " 2.1 What is child development? In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what exactly constitutes child development. One of the first rigorous studies in the field (Shirley 1931) was executed under the explicit aim … that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously. Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these domains of development. Figure 2.1: Gross motor development as a sequence of milestones. Source: Shirley (1933). Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure 2.1 illustrates the various stages needed for going from a fetal posture to walking alone. The ages are indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in timing between infants. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development: Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in an orderly sequence. Gesell’s definition emphasizes that development is a continuous process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves. Liebert, Poulos, and Strauss (1974) (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon that unfolds in isolation. Development refers to a process in growth and capability over time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with the environment. Cameron and Bogin (2012) (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows: “Growth” is defined as an increase in size, while “maturity” or “development” is an increase in functional ability…The endpoint of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate successfully … not just biological maturity but also behavioral and perhaps social maturity. Berk (2011) (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on child development as follows: Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions, each representing a different skill area that may undergo both continuous and stagewise transformation. There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given here just illustrate the main points of view in the field. References "],
["sec-theories.html", "2.2 Theories of child development", " 2.2 Theories of child development The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g. Santrock (2011), Berk (2011)), or by searching for the topic of interest in an encyclopedia (e.g. Salkind (2002)). The introductions by Santrock (2011) and Berk (2011) both distinguish major theories in child development according to how each answers to following three questions: 2.2.1 Continuous or discontinuous? Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring from one stage to another? Many stage-based theories of human development have been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by Erikson (Erikson 1963), Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (Kohlberg 1984) and Piaget’s cognitive development theory (Piaget and Inhelder 1969). Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout childhood. The first period, the sensimotor period (approximately 0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these six stages describe “the road to conceptual thought”. Piaget’s stages are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism in intellectual development. On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a continuous process. Gesell (1943) (p. 88) says: A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on. 2.2.2 One course or many? Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the work of Gesell. The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion, so there may be multiple ways to reach the same point. Figure 2.2 illustrates that the path taken by a given child will depend on the child’s unique combination of personal and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in development. Figure 2.2: A representation of the dynamic systems viewpoint on how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point using different paths. Source: Berk (2011). 2.2.3 Nature or nurture? Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question how to explain individual differences. Maturation usually defined as the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that differences in development are innate and stable over time, but that there may be differences in speed. Others argue that individual differences are primarily driven by environmental factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child development. The answer — if there is one — in this stability-versus-plasticity debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that differences are natural and stable, then it may not make sense trying to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to be small. On the other hand, if we view development as plastic, then improving the environment may have substantial pay-offs in terms of improved development. References "],
["sec-motorexample.html", "2.3 Example of motor development", " 2.3 Example of motor development 2.3.1 Shirley’s motor data For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in the classic study on child development among 25 babies by Shirley (1931). Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of the baby’s walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room, and lightly greases the soles of the baby’s feet with olive oil. The baby was invited to “walk” on the sheet. Of course, very young infants need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were repeated every week or bi-weekly. Table 2.1: Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) for 21 babies (Shirley 1931, Appendix 8).

Table 2.1 lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and walking alone, as taken from Table 3 in van Buuren and Leeuw (1992). Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark in the first column the babies were already stepping when the observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she could walk alone. 2.3.2 Individual trajectories of motor development Figure 2.3: Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Figure 2.3 is a visual representation of the information in Table 2.1. Each data point is the age of first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs, there is a jump to the next level. The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry) or who jump over stages (Martin, Max). For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no sensible interpretation. We might be inclined to think that the vertical distance portrays to how difficult it is to achieve the next stage, but this is inaccurate. Instead, difficulty of passing from one stage to the next corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction between stages. For example, on average the line for stepping is rather short in all plots, so going from stepping to standing is relatively easy. The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher. Shirley (1931) actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure 2.3 plot only the 76 visits that showed a jump. In order to obtain individual curves like these, the data collection needs to be intense and costly. Fortunately, there are alternatives that are much more efficient. References "],

["sec-agebased.html", "3.1 Age-based measurement of development", " 3.1 Age-based measurement of development 3.1.1 Motivation for age-based measurement The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to describe the behavior expected at a selected age. Gesell (1943) (p. 89) formulates this goal as follows: We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age. There is a large literature that quantifies development in terms of ages at which the child is expected to show a specific behavior. For example, in Shirley’s motor data in Table 2.1, we may summarize the ages at which each of the 21 children enters a given stage. Figure 3.1: Ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. 3.1.2 Age equivalent as difficulty Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of a given developmental milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of the age at which children achieve it. For example, Stott (1967) (p. 25) defines the age equivalent and its use for measurement, as follows: The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age at which children reach that particular stage. Figure 3.2: Boxplot and mean (symbol x) of the ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. Figure 3.2 adds boxplot and the mean age at which the children enter the four stages. The difficulty of the stages can thus be expressed as age equivalents: 16.1 weeks for stepping, 27.2 weeks for standing, 43.3 weeks for walking with help and 63.3 weeks for walking alone. Alternatives to the mean age equivalent include the ages at which 10, 50 or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of reasoning has led to the widely used concept of developmental age as a measure of a child’s development (in body size or motor skill or psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms. 3.1.3 Limitations of age-based measurement Age-based measurement is easy to understand, but is not without pitfalls: Age-based measurement can inform us whether a child is earlier or later for a given milestone. However, it does not tell us what behaviors are characteristic for a child of a given age. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there is no norms, we cannot quantify development. Age-based measurement intertwines quantification of development with evaluation of development. Age-based measurement only works at the milestone level, and is cumbersome to apply with multiple milestones. References "],
["sec-scorebased.html", "3.2 Score-based measurement of development", " 3.2 Score-based measurement of development 3.2.1 Motivation for score-based measurement Score-based measurement takes the responses on multiple milestones and counts the total number of passed milestones as a measure of child’s development. This approach takes multiple measurement into account, hence leading to a more stable measurement. If milestones are ordered in difficulty, so one may skip milestones that are too easy, and stop when milestones become too difficult for the child, for example as age-forms. In such cases, we cannot simply interpret the sum score of a measure of development, and need to correct for the subset of milestones that was actually administered. The usual working assumption is that the child would have passed all easier milestones and failed on all more difficult milestones. This procedure is typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor, cognitive, and so on. 3.2.2 Example of score-based measurement Figure 3.3: Same data as in Figure 2.3, but now with the vertical axis representing gross-motor score. Figure 3.3 is a gross-motor score calculated as the number of milestones passed. It varies from 0 to 3. The plot suggests that the difference in development between scores 0 and 1 is the same as the difference in development between, say, scores 2 and 3. This is not true. For example, suppose that we express difficulty of the milestone as an age-equivalent. From section 3.1.2 we see that the difference in difficulty between stepping and standing is 27.2 - 16.1 = 11.1 weeks, whereas the difference between walking alone and walking with help is 63.3 - 43.3 = 20 weeks. Thus, according to age equivalents scores 0 and 1 should be closer to each other, and scores 2 and 3 should be drawn wider apart. 3.2.3 Limitations of score-based measurement Score-based measurement is today’s dominant approach, but is not without conceptual and logistical issues. The total score depends not only on the (true) developmental status of the child, but also on the set of milestones actually administered. If a milestone is skipped or added, the sum score cannot be interpreted anymore as a measure of the child’s developmental status. It is not possible to compare scores made by different instruments. Some instruments allows conversion to age-conditional scores. However, the sample used to derive such conversions are typically restricted to one instrument, and does not extend to measurements made by other instruments. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive milestones tap into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The materials are often proprietary and sometimes costly. "],
["sec-unitbased.html", "3.3 Unit-based measurement of development", " 3.3 Unit-based measurement of development 3.3.1 Motivation for unit-based measurement Unit-based measurement starts by defining the ideal properties of the measurement, and derives a procedure to aggregate the responses on milestones into an overall score that will meet the ideal. Section 2.4 highlighted questions for individuals, groups and populations. There are basically three questions: What is the difference in development over time for the same child, group or population? What is the difference in development between different children, groups or populations of the same age? How does child development compare to a norm? In the ideal situation, we would like to have a continuous (latent) variable \\(D\\) (for development) that measures child development. The scale should allow us to quantify ability of persons, groups or populations from low to high. The scale should have a constant unit, so that a given difference in ability quantifies means the same across the entire scale, just like that a difference of 10 cm means the same irrespective of whether we compare the heights of books or houses. When are these conditions are met, we say that we measure on an interval scale. If we succeed in creating an interval scale for child development, an enormous arsenal of technique developed for quantitative variables opens up to measure, track and analyze child development. We may then evaluate the development of a child in terms of \\(D\\) points gained, create age-dependent charts for development (just like growth charts for height and weight), devise age-conditional measures for child development, and intelligent adaptive testing schemes. Promising studies on Dutch data (Jacobusse, van Buuren, and Verkerk (2006), Jacobusse and van Buuren (2007), van Buuren (2014)) suggest that such benefits are well within reach. 3.3.2 Example of

Each of the measurements is coded as a PASS (1) or a FAIL (0). It is now straighforward to calculate the probability of passing each milestone at different ages. Figure 3.4: Probability of achieving four motor milestones against age. Data from Table 3.1. Figure 3.4 plots the empirical probablity curves of passing each motor milestone. Observe there if a gradual decline in the steepness as we move from stepping to walk_alone. This pattern of flattening is typical for child development, and is evidence that development is faster at earlier ages. Thus, it takes less time to go from 10 to 90 percent in stepping than it takes for walk_alone. Figure 3.5: Modeled probability of achieving four motor milestones against the \\(D\\)-score. Data from Table 3.1. Figure 3.5 is similar to Figure 3.4, but with Age is replaced by Ability, and with the empirical curves replaced by modelled curves. The ability values on the horizontal axis are estimated from the data and correspond to the amount of development of each measurement. Also, the logistic curves are estimated from the data, and reflect the probability of passing each milestone at a given level of ability. The figure shows that the probability of passing an milestone increases with ability. Milestones are ordered in difficulty from left to right. Milestone stepping is the easiest and walk_alone is most difficult. The point at which a logistic curve crosses the 50 percent line (marked by a cross) is customarily taken as the difficulty of the milestone. The increase in ability that is needed to go from 10 to 90 percent is about five units here. Since all curves are parallel, the interval is constant for all scale locations. Thus, the scale is an interval scale with a constant unit of measurement. This is the type of measurement scale needed for answering the basic questions identified in Section 3.3.1. 3.3.3 Limitations of unit-based measurement While unit-based measurement has many advantages, it cannot perform miracles. An important assumption is that the milestones “measure the same thing”, or put differently, are manifestations of an underlying continuous latent variable that can be measured by empirical observations. Unit-based measurement won’t work if there is no sensible latent scale. The portrayed advantages hold only if the discrepancies between the data and the model are relatively small. Since the simplest and most powerful measurement models are very strict, it is important to assess and increase the fit between data and model. The construction of unit-based measurement requires psychometric expertise, specialized computer software and considerable sample sizes. References "],
["sec-whatismeasurement.html", "3.4 What is measurement?", " 3.4 What is measurement? Measurement is the process of locating milestones and children on a line. This line represents a latent variable, a continuous construct that defines the different poles of the concept that we want to measure. In our case, the concept is child development. Other constructs, like height, temperature or happiness would be equally valid constructs. A latent variable ranges from low to high. A latent variable cannot be measured directly. It is a theoretical construct. Figure 3.6: Placing milestones and children onto the same line reveals their positions. Figure 3.6 shows the imaginary positions on a gross-motor continuum of three babies from Figure 2.1 at the age of 30 weeks. Both milestones and children are ordered along the continuum. Thus, standing is more difficult than stepping, and at week 30, Doris is ahead of Walley in terms of motor development. Latent variable cannot be measured directly. However, we may be able to actually measure variables (milestones) that are related to the latent variable. For example, we may have the child’s scores on tasks like standing or walking with help. The measurement model specifies the relations between the data and the latent variable. Under a given measurement model, we may estimate the locations of milestones and children on the line. Section 4.5 discusses measurement models in more detail. "],

Criterion Age-based Score-based Unit-based Independent of age norm NO YES YES Supports multiple milestones NO YES YES Latent variable NO YES YES Robust to milestone skipping YES NO YES Comparable scores YES NO YES Probability model NO NO YES Defines measurement unit NO NO YES This chapter distinguished three approaches to measure child development: age-based, score-based and unit-based measurement. Table 3.2 summarizes how the approaches evaluate on nine criteria. Age-based measurement expresses development in age equivalents, whose precise definition depends on the reference population. Age-based measurement does not support multiple milestones, and does not used the concept of a latent variable. Score-based measurement quantifies development by summing the number of passes. Different instruments make different selections of milestones, so the measurements taken are unique to the instruments, so comparing the measurement obtained by different instruments is difficult. Corrections are needed if milestones are skipped or added. Unit-based measurement defines a unit of measurement by a theoretical model. When the data fit the model, we are able to construct instruments that produce measurement in a common metric. "],

["sec-ddi.html", "4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI)", " 4.1 The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) 4.1.1 Setting The Dutch Youth Health Care (YHC) routinely monitors development of almost all children living in The Netherlands. During the first four years, there are 13 scheduled visits. During these visits, the YHC professionals evaluate - amongst others - growth and development of the child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI; in Dutch: Van Wiechenschema) is the standard instrument used to measure development during the ages 0-4 years. The DDI consists of 75 milestones. The instrument assesses three developmental domains: Fine motor, adaptation, personality and social behavior; Communication Gross motor The milestones are organized on two forms, one for children aged 0-15 months, and another for children ages 15-54 months. The YHC professionals administer an age-appropriate subset at each of the scheduled visits, thus building a longitudinal developmental profile for each child. 4.1.2 Description of SMOCC study The Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics (SMOCC) study is a a nationally representative cohort of 2,151 children born in The Netherlands during the years 1988–1989 (Herngreen et al. 1994). The study monitored child development using observations made on the DDI during 10 visits in the first 30 months of life. The standard set in the DDI consists of relatively easy milestones that 90 percent of the children can pass at the scheduled age. This set of designed to have maximal sensitivity for picking up delays in development. A special feature of the SMOCC study was the inclusion of additional, and more difficult, milestones beyond the standard set. The additional milestones are taken as the set for the next time point. The success percentage on additional milestones is about 50 percent. 4.1.3 Codebook of Dutch Development Instrument 0-15 months Table 4.1: Codebook of DDI, 0-15 months Item Domain Label ddicmm029 Communication Reacts when spoken to ddicmm030 Communication Smiles in response (M; can ask parents) ddicmm031 Communication vocalizes in response ddicmm033 Communication Says dada, baba, gaga ddicmm034 Communication Babbles while playing ddicmm036 Communication Waves ‘bye-bye’ (M; can ask parents) ddicmm037 Communication Uses two words with comprehension ddicmm039 Communication Says three ‘words’ ddicmm040 Communication Understands ‘play’ orders.

From section 3.4 we quote: The measurement model specifies the relations between the data and the latent variable. The scientific theory of measurement models is known under the name of Item Response Theory (IRT). Good introductory works include Wright and Masters (1982), Embretsen and Reise (2000) and Engelhard Jr. (2013). IRT models enables quantification of the locations of both items (milestones) and persons on the latent variable. We reserve the term item for generic properties, and milestone for child development. In general, items are part of the measurement instrument, persons are the objects to be measured. An IRT model has three major stuctural components: Specification of the underlying latent variable(s). In this work, we restrict ourselves to models with just one latent variable. Multi-dimensional IRT models do have their uses, but they are complicated to fit and not widely used; For a given item, a specification of the probability of success given a value on the latent variables. This specification can take many forms. Section 4.6 focusses on this in more detail; Specification how probability models for the different items should be combined. In this work, we will restrict to models that assume local independence of the probabilities. In that case, the probability that two items are passed can be found by multiplying each item’s success probability. 4.5.2 Adapt the model? Or adapt the data? The measurement model induces a predictable pattern in the observed items, and this pattern can be tested against the observed data. When there is misfit between the expected and observed data, we can follow two strategies: Make the measurement model more general. Discard items (and sometimes persons) to make the model fit. These are very different strategies that have led to heated debates among psychometricians. See Engelhard Jr. (2013) for an overview. In this work, we opt for the - very strict - Rasch model (Rasch (1960)), and will adapt the data to reduce discrepancies between model and data. Arguments for this choice are given later, in Section 4.8. References "],
["sec-itemresponsefunctions.html", "4.6 Item response functions", " 4.6 Item response functions Most measurement models describe the probability of passing an item as a function of the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty. A person with low ability will almost surely fail a difficult item, whereas a highly able person will almost surely pass an easy item. Let us now introduce a few symbols. We adopt the notation used in Wright and Masters (1982). See Chapter 12 for a complete list. Symbol Term Description \\(\\beta_n\\) Ability True (but unknown) developmental score of child \\(n\\) \\(\\delta_i\\) Difficulty True (but unknown) difficulty of an item \\(i\\) \\(\\pi_{ni}\\) Probability Probability that child \\(n\\) passes item \\(i\\) Thus, Figure 3.6 shows three \\(\\beta_n\\)’s and four \\(\\delta_i\\)’s. The difference between ability of child \\(n\\) and difficulty of item \\(i\\) is \\[\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\] In the special case that \\(\\beta_n = \\delta_i\\), the person will have a probability of 0.5 of passing the item. 4.6.1 Logistic model A widely used method to map differences on the latent scale are logistic units (or logits) (Berkson 1944). In R we can calculate the probability by the inverse-logit (or logistic function) for a difference of 0 and 1 as plogis(c(0, 1)) ## [1] 0.500 0.731 Figure 4.5: Standard logistic curve. Percentage of children passing an item for a given ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). Figure 4.5 shows how the percentage that pass the item varies in terms of the ability-difficulty gap \\(\\beta_n - \\delta_i\\). The gap can vary either by \\(\\beta_n\\) or \\(\\delta_i\\), so we may use the graph in two ways: To find the probability of passing various items for a child with ability \\(\\beta_n\\). If \\(\\delta_i = \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\delta_i &lt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\delta_i &gt; \\beta_n\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). To find the probability of passing a given item \\(\\delta_i\\) for children that vary in ability. If \\(\\beta_n = \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} = 0.5\\). If \\(\\beta_n &lt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &lt; 0.5\\), and if \\(\\beta_n &gt; \\delta_i\\) then \\(\\pi_{ni} &gt; 0.5\\). 4.6.2 Types of item response functions The standard logistic function is by no means the only option to map the relation between the latent variable and the probability of passing an item. The logistic function is the dominant choice in IRT, but it is instructive to study some other mappings. The item response function maps success probability against ability. Figure 4.6: Item response functions for five hypothetical items, each demonstrating a positive relation between ability and probability to pass. Figure 4.6 illustrates several other possibilities. Let us consider five hypothetical items, A-E. Note that the horizontal axis now refers to ability, instead of ability-item gap in 4.5. A: Item A is the logistic function discussed in Section 4.6. B: For item B, the probability of passing is constant at 30 percent. This 30 percent is not related to ability. This item does not measure ability, and only adds to the noise. It is a bad item for measurement. C: Item C is step function centered at an ability level of 1, so all children with an ability below 1 logit fail, and all children with ability above 1 pass. This is the ideal item for discriminating children with an abilities above and below 1. The item is not sensitive to differences at other ability levels, and often not so realistic in practice. D: Like A, item D is a smoothly increasing logistic function, but it has an extra parameter that allows it to vary its slope (or discrimination). The extra parameter can make the curve steeper (more discriminatory) than the red curve, in the limit approaching a step curve. It can also become shallower (less discriminatory) than the red curve (as plotted here), in the limit approaching a constant curve (item B). Thus, item D generalizes items A, B or C. E: Item E is even more general in the sense that it need not be logistic, but a general monotonically increasing function. As plotted, the item is insensitive to abilities between -1 and 0 logits, and more sensitive to abilities between 0 to 2 logits. These are just some examples of how the relation between the child’s ability and passing probability could look. In practice, the curves need not start at 0 percent or end at 100 percent. They could also be U-shaped, of have other non-monotonic forms. See Coombs (1964) for a thorough overview of such models. In practice, most models are restricted to shapes A-D. 4.6.3 Person response functions The roles of persons and items can be switched. The person response function tells us how likely it is that a single person can pass an item, or more commonly, a set of items. Let us continue with items A, C and D from Figure 4.6, and calculate the response function for three children, respectively with abilities \\(\\beta_1 = -2\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0\\) and \\(\\beta_3 = 2\\). Figure 4.7: Person response functions for three children with abilities -2, 0 and +2, using a small test of items A, C and D. Figure 4.7 presents the person response functions from three persons with abilities of -2, 0 and +2 logits. The functions are calculated as the average of response probabilities on items A, C and D. Thus, on average, we expect that child 1 will pass an easy item of difficulty -3 in about 60 percent of the time, whereas for an intermediate item of difficulty of -1 the passing probility would be 10 percent. For child 3, with a higher ability, these probabilities are quite different: 97% and 90%. The substantial drop in the middle of the curve is caused by the step function of item A. References "],
["sec-engelhard.html", "4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement", " 4.7 Engelhard criteria for invariant measurement In this work, we strive to achieve invariant measurement, a very strict form of measurements that is subject to the following requirements (Engelhard Jr. (2013), p. 14): Item-invariant measurement of persons: The measurement of persons must be independent of the particular items that happen to be used for the measuring. Non-crossing persons response functions: A more able person must always have a better chance of success on an item that a less able person. Person-invariant calibration of test items: The calibration of the items must be independent of the particular persons used for calibration. Non-crossing item response functions: Any person must have a better chance of success on an easy item than on a more difficult item. Unidimensionality: Items and persons must be simultaneously located on a single underlying latent variable. Three families of IRT models actually support invariant measurement: Scalogram model (Guttman (1950)) Rasch model (Rasch (1960), Andrich (1978), Wright and Masters (1982)) Mokken scaling model (Mokken (1971), Molenaar (1997)) The Guttman and Mokken model yield an ordinal latent scale, while the Rasch model yields an interval scale (with a constant unit).

Interval scale: When it fits, the Rasch model provides an interval scale, the de-facto requirement for any numerical comparisons (c.f. Section 3.3.1). Parsimonious: The Rasch model has one parameter for each item and one parameter for each person. It’s one of the most parsimonous IRT models, and can easily be applied to thousands of items and millions of persons. Specific objectivity: Person and item parameters are mathematically separate entities in the Rasch model. In practice, this means that the estimated difference in ability between two persons does not depend on the difficulty of the test. Also, the estimated differences in difficulties between two items does not depend on the abilities in the calibration sample.

The DDI scores are coded as 0 (FAIL) or 1 (PASS). Since the selection of milestones depends on age, the dataset contains a large number of empty cells. Naive use of sum scores as a proxy to person ability is therefore problematic. An empty cell is not a FAIL, so it’s an error to impute those cells by zeroes. Note that some rows contain only 1’s, e.g., in row 2 or row 10. Many computer program for Rasch analysis routinely remove such perfect scores before fitting. However, unless the number of perfect scores is very small, this is not recommended because doing so can severely affect the distribution of person abilities. In order to effectively handle the missing data and to preserve all persons in the analysis we separate estimation of item difficulties and person abilities into two steps. "],
["sec-itemestimation.html", "5.2 Item parameter estimation", " 5.2 Item parameter estimation There are many methods for estimating the difficulty parameters of the Rasch estimation. See Linacre (2004) for an overview. We will use the pairwise method estimation method (Zwinderman (1995)), as implemented in the function rasch.pairwise.itemcluster() of the sirt package (Robitzsch (2016)). Figure 5.1: Estimated item difficulty parameters (\\(d_i\\)) for 57 milestones of the DDI (0 - 2 years). Figure 5.1 summarizes the estimated item difficulty parameters. Although the model makes no distinction between domains, the results have been ordered to ease spotting of the natural progression of the milestones per domain. The figure also suggests that not all domain are equally represented across the scale. For example, there are no communication milestones around the logit of \\(-10\\). References "],
["sec-anchoring.html", "5.3 Anchoring", " 5.3 Anchoring The Rasch model identifies the item difficulties up to a linear transformation. By default, the software produces estimates in the logit scale (c.f. Figure 5.1). The logit scale is inconvenient for two reasons: The logit scale has negative values. Negative values do not have a sensible interpretation in child development, and are likely to introduce errors in practice; Both the zero in the logit scale as well as its variance depend on the sample used to calibrate the item difficulties. The properties of the Rasch model are preserved under a rescaling of the derived scale. In order to make the scale independent of the specified sample, we transform the scale so that two items will always have the same value on the transformed scale. The choice of the two anchor items is essentially arbitrary, but they should correspond to milestones that are easy to measure with small error. In the sequel, we use the two milestones to anchor the scale: Value Item Label 20 ddigmd057 Lifts head to 45 degrees on prone position 40 ddigmd063 Sits in stable position without support This is called the \\(D\\)-score scale. With this choice, \\(D\\)-score values are approximately 0\\(D\\) around birth. At the age of 1 year, the score will around 50\\(D\\), so during the first year of life, one \\(D\\) unit corresponds to approximately a one-week interval.

["sec-dscoreestimation.html", "5.4 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score", " 5.4 Estimation of the \\(D\\)-score The \\(D\\)-score quantifies development of a child. In order to calculate the \\(D\\)-score we need the following ingredients: Child’s PASS/FAIL scores on the milestones administered; The difficulty estimates of each milestone administered; A prior distribution, an estimate of the \\(D\\)-score distribution before seeing any PASS/FAIL score. Using these inputs, we may use Bayes theorem to calculate the position of the person on the latent variable. The method is known as the Expected a posteriori (EAP) estimation, and was first described by Bock and Mislevy (1982). 5.4.1 EAP algorithm Calculation of the \\(D\\)-score proceeds item by item. Suppose we have some vague and preliminary idea about the distribution of \\(D\\). The procedure uses Bayes rule to update this prior knowledge with data from the first item (fail/pass score, item difficulty) to calculate the posterior. In the next step, this posterior is used as the prior for the next item, and so on. The procedure stops when all items have been used. The order in which items are entered does not matter for the end result. The \\(D\\)-score is equal to the mean of the last posterior. 5.4.2 Age-dependent starting prior In the first step, we need a starting distribution as prior. The starting prior should define the range of reasonable values for \\(D\\). For example, an infant aged 1 months the \\(D\\)-score will have lower \\(D\\)-score than a child aged 15 months. The prior should be a bit informative but not too much, so it was decided to choose a broad distribution which was centred quite well. The prior was chosen as a normal distribution with a mean equal to the \\(D\\)-score expected at the child’s age, and with a standard deviation of 5, which about twice the normal variation in the \\(D\\)-score. Figure 5.3: Age-dependent starting priors for the D-score at the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months Figure 5.3 illustrates starting distributions (priors) for the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months. As expected, the assumed ability of an infant aged of 1 month is lower than that of a child aged 15 months, which in turn is lower than the ability of a toddler aged 24 months. 5.4.3 Numerical example Suppose we measure two boys aged 15 months, David and Rob, by the DDI. David passes the first four milestones, but does not complete the test. Rob completes the test, but fails on two out of five milestones. Table 5.2: Scores of David and Rob on five milestones from the DDI Item Label Delta David Rob ddifmd011 Puts cube in and out of a box 46.0 1 0 ddifmm012 Plays ‘give and take’ (M; can ask parents) 46.5 1 1 ddicmm037 Uses two words with comprehension 50.1 1 1 ddigmm066 Crawls, abdomen off the floor (M; can ask parents) 46.1 1 1 ddigmm067 Walks while holding onto play-pen or furniture 46.1 NA 0 Table 5.2 shows the difficulties of each milestone and the responses of David and Rob for the standard five DDI milestones for the age of 15 months. The mean \\(D\\)-score for Dutch children aged 15 months is 53.6\\(D\\), so the milestones are easy to pass at this age, with the most difficult being ddicmm037. David passed all milestones, but has no score on the last. Rob fails on ddifmm012 and ddigmm067. How do we calculate the \\(D\\)-score for David and Rob? Figure 5.4: \\(D\\)-score distribution for David and Rob before (prior) and after (posterior) a milestone is taken into account. Figure 5.4 shows how the prior transforms into the posterior after the measurement outcomes is fed into the calculation. There are five milestones, and so calculation is done in five steps: Both David and Rob pass ddifmd011. The prior (lightgreen) is the same as in Figure 5.3. After a PASS, the posterior will be located more to the right, and will often be more peaked. Both happen here, but the change is small. The reason is that a PASS on this milestone is not very informative. For a child with a true \\(D\\)-score of 53\\(D\\), the probability of passing ddifmd011 is equal to 0.966. If passing is so common, there is not much information in the measurement. David passes ddifmm012 but Rob does not. Observe that the prior is identical to the posterior of ddifmd011. For David, the posterior is only slightly different from the prior, for the same reason as above. For Rob, we find a huge change to the left, both in terms of location (from 54.3\\(D\\) to 47.1\\(D\\)) and in terms of peakedness. This one FAIL lowers Rob’s score by 7.2\\(D\\). Milestone ddicmm037 is more difficult than the previous two milestones, so a pass on ddicmm037 does have a clear effect on the posterior for both David and Rob. David’s PASS on ddigmm066 does not bring any additional information, so his prior and posterior are virtually indistinguishable. For Rob, we find a slight effect to the right. There is no measurement for David on ddigmm067, so the prior and posterior are equivalent. For Rob, we observe a FAIL, which shifts his posterior to the left. The \\(D\\)-score is calculated as the mean of the posterior. David’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 55.7\\(D\\). Note that the measurement error, as estimated from the variance of the posterior, is fairly large. Rob’s \\(D\\)-score is equal to 47.7\\(D\\), with a much smaller measurement error. This result is consistent with the design principles of the DDI, which is meant to detect children with developmental delay. The example illustrates that the effects of the measurement on the \\(D\\)-score depend on the match between the true (but unknown) \\(D\\)-score of the child and the difficulty of the milestone. 5.4.4 Technical observations on \\(D\\)-score estimation Administration of a very easy set of milestones introduces a ceiling with children that pass all milestones, but whose true \\(D\\)-score could extend well beyond the ceiling. Depending on the goal of the measurement, this may or may not be a problem. The specification of the prior and posterior distributions requires a set of quadrature points at which their densities are calculated. The set of quadrature is taken here as the static and evenly-spaced set of integers between -10 and +80. Using other quadrature points may have a slight effect on the estimate. The actual calculations are here done item by item. A more efficient method is to handle all responses at once. The end result will be the same. References "],

["sec-itemfit.html", "6.1 Item fit", " 6.1 Item fit The philosophy of the Rasch model is different from conventional statistical modeling. It is not the task of the Rasch model to account for the data. Rather it is the task of the data to fit the Rasch model. We saw this distinction before in Section 4.5.2. The goal of model fit assessment is to explore and quantify how well empirical data meet the requirements of the Rasch model. One way to gauge model fit is to compare the observed probability of passing an item to the fitted item response curve for endorsing the item. The fitted item response curve for each item \\(i\\) is modeled as: \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{exp( \\beta_{n} - \\delta_{i})}{1+exp(\\beta_{n}-\\delta_{i})}, \\] where \\(\\beta_n\\) is the ability of person \\(n\\) and \\(\\delta_i\\) is the difficulty of item \\(i\\). It is thus natural to compare the observed and modelled probabilities at various levels of ability. 6.1.1 Well-fitting item response curves Figure 6.1: Empirical and fitted item response curves for two milestones from the DDI (SMOCC data). Figure 6.1 shows the item characteristics curves of two DDI milestones. The orange line represents the empirical probability at different ability levels. The dashed line represents the estimated item response curve according to the Rasch model. The empirical and estimated curves are close together, so both items fit the model very well. 6.1.2 Item response curves showing severe underfit These examples of item response curves fit the model nicely. There are however many cases where things are less bright. Figure 6.2: Three simulated items that illustrate various forms of item misfit. Figure 6.2 shows three forms of severe underfit. The probability to pass item hypgmd001 is almost constant across ability, so retaining this item essentially only adds to the noise. Item hypgmd002 converges to an asymptote around 80 percent and has a severe dip in the middle. The dip is caused by the strong relation to age. Item hypgmd003 appears to have the wrong coding. In addition, the spike-like behavior in the middle is often seen when two or more different items are erroneously given the same code. Removing of items like these could substantially improve model fit. 6.1.3 Item response curves showing overfit Figure 6.3: Two simulated items that illustrate item overfit. Figure 6.3 shows two forms of overfit. The curve of item hypgmd004 is much steeper than the modelled curve. Thus, just this one item is exceptionally well-suited to distinguish children with a \\(D\\)-score below 50 from those with a \\(D\\)-score above 50. Note that the item isn’t sensitive anywhere else on the scale. In general, having items like these is good news, because they allow us to increase the reliability of the instrument. One should make certain though, that FAIL and PASS scores are all measured (not imputed) values. Multiple perfect items could hint to a violation of the local independence assumption (c.f. Section 4.5). Developmental milestones sometimes have combinations of responses that are impossible. For example, one cannot walk without being able to stand, so the inconsistent combination (stand: FAIL, walk: PASS) will not be observed. This leads to more consistent responses that would be expected by chance. In principle, one could combine the two such items into one three-category items, which effectively set the probability of inconsistent combinations to zero. Item hypgmd005 is also steep, but has an asymptote around 80 percent. This causes discrepancies between the empirical and modelled curves around the middle of the probability scale. In general, such items could be removed if a sufficient number of better items are available. 6.1.4 Item infit and outfit The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlying, on-target, unexpected responses. So, the infit measures the extend to which the observed data follow the model and that the responses are as expected. This fit is harder to observe visually, because the infit is sensitive to small errors in individual response patterns. A pattern that can be observed is when the observed data points actually have a steeper curve, compared to the model. This pattern, with a very steep curve, is called the Gutman pattern and actually fits the model very well and would even discriminate better (plot on the left). An example of a larger infit is when an item seems to follow the curve well but has some odd data points along the way (plot on the right) The item fit can also be inspected by using the statistical fit-measures. To determine the fit of items to the model we compare the observed responses and the expected values. The observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) of person \\(n\\) on item \\(i\\) can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). The expected response \\(P_{ni}\\) is modelled as \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{exp( \\beta_{n} - \\delta_{i} )}{1+exp(\\beta_{n}-\\delta_{i})}\\]. The difference between the observed and the expected responses are the residual errors. The item infit is the sum of the squared errors divided by the sum of the expected response variances \\(W_{ni}\\). The expected response variance \\(W_{ni}\\) can be obtained as \\(P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})\\). The outfit is calculated as the sum of the squared standardized errors. The residual errors are standardized by dividing by the expected binomial standard deviation: \\[z_{ni} = \\frac{x_{ni}-P_{ni}}{\\sqrt{W_{ni}}}\\] Accordingly the infit and outfit are calculated as: \\[Infit = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_n^N W_{ni}}\\] \\[Outfit = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^N z_{ni}^2}{N}\\] As a guideline for interpreting the item fit-measures a threshold of fit &lt; 1 can be used when you want to be very strict in the item selection and only select the absolute best items. This threshold would be used when the amount of available items is rather large. When the selection should be less strict a thresold of fit &lt; 1.3 can be considered. "],
["sec-personfit.html", "6.2 Person fit", " 6.2 Person fit The fit of the persons evaluates the extent to which the responses of any person conform to the Rasch model expectation. The Rasch model expects that a more able person has a greater probabilty to pass any item than a less able person. Fit analysis evaluates the extend to which this is true for any person. Two types of person fit are distinguished: the person outfit and the person infit. The outfit evaluates the extent to which the responses to of the persons are consistent with the model. In other words wheter persons with a lower ability also have a lower probability to pass items. The outfit statistic is heavily infulenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlying, on-target, unexpected responses. To determine the fit of persons to the model we compare the observed responses and the expected values. The observed response \\(x_{ni}\\) of person \\(n\\) on item \\(i\\) can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). The expected response \\(P_{ni}\\) is modelled as \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{exp( \\beta_{n} - \\delta_{i} )}{1+exp(\\beta_{n}-\\delta_{i})}\\]. The difference between the observed and the expected responses are the residual errors. The person infit is the sum of the squared errors divided by the sum of the expected response variances \\(W_{ni}\\). The expected response variance \\(W_{ni}\\) can be obtained as \\(P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})\\). The outfit is calculated as the sum of the squared standardizes errors accumulated over the items \\(L\\) to evaluate the plausability of any person response. The residual errors are standardized by dividing by the expected binomial standard deviation: \\[z_{ni} = \\frac{x_{ni}-P_{ni}}{\\sqrt{W_{ni}}}\\]. Accordingly the infit and outfit are calculated as: \\[Infit = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^L (x_{ni}-P_{ni})^2}{\\sum_n^L W_{ni}}\\] \\[Outfit = \\frac{\\sum_{n}^L z_{ni}^2}{L}\\]. As a threshold for person fit &lt; 3 can be used to clean out persons with inplausible response patterns. "],
["sec-dif.html", "6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF)", " 6.3 Differential item functioning (DIF) An important aspect of item fit to the Rasch model is the assumption that items have the same difficulty in different subgroups of respondents, which is called Differential Item Functioning (DIF). Zumbo (1999) describes a clear definition: “DIF occurs when examinees from different groups show differing probabilities of success on (or endorsing) the item after matching on the underlying ability that the item is intended to measure.” (Zumbo 1999) The examination of DIF can be done by modelling the probability of endorsing an item in a logistic regression model by the ability from the Rasch model and a grouping variable. When the grouping variable significantly explains residual variance of the item scores after adjusting for the ability, the item presents DIF for that group. DIF can be visually inspected by plotting the curves for the subgroups separately. For example when inspecting the DIF for male and female respondents, the following two milestones do not shown DIF: ## Item: 1 ddigmd063 ## Item: 1 ddifmd011 However, these two items do show a small amount of DIF. This means that the difficulty for the items for male respondent is different than for female respondents. The milestone “Says three words” is less difficult for female respondents, whereas the milestone “Walks while holding onto play-pen or furniture” is less difficult for the male respondents. ## Item: 1 ddicmm039 ## Item: 1 ddigmm067 References "],
["sec-iteminformation.html", "6.4 Item information", " 6.4 Item information 6.4.1 Item information at a given ability The item information is defined as the amount of psychometric information an item contains for a given ability. The item information can be plotted for each item. In the Figure below, the item information curves for some example milestones are displayed. The amount of information for an item is maximized around the item-difficulty parameter. The formula to obtain the item information is the first derivative of the item response curve and can be written as follows: \\[I(\\delta)=P_i(\\delta)(1-P_i(\\delta))\\] where \\(P_i(\\delta)\\) is the conditional probability of endorsing an item. For example for milestone “Says three words” the \\(\\delta_i\\) equals \\(3.81\\). The probability of endorsing this item for a person with an ability level of \\(2\\) standard deviation above the mean is \\[P_{ni}= \\frac{exp(2 - 3.81)}{1+exp(2-3.81)}\\] \\[P_{ni}= 0.14\\] So for an ability level of \\(2\\) standard deviations above the mean \\(\\beta_n=2\\), milestone “Says three words” has an information value of \\[I(\\delta)=0.14(1-0.14)\\] \\[I(\\delta)=0.12\\] 6.4.2 Item information at a given age The item information can also be expressed against age.

The item will be most informative, when adiminered at the age at which 50% of the respondents will pass the item. Administering the item at this age can be helpful when the item is used in an instrument to determine the ability of a population. However, when the item is used in a screening instrument, the goal would be to identify respondents that underperform compared to a norm group. In that case, the item can best be asessed at the age where 90% of respondents will pass the item. "],
["sec-reliability.html", "6.5 Reliability", " 6.5 Reliability The person seperation index is a measure for reliability for the Rasch model that is comparable to Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\).

There are many different types of validity, that can roughly be distinguised in two main kinds of validity: internal validity and external validity. "],
["internal-validity.html", "7.2 Internal validity", " 7.2 Internal validity 7.2.1 Content validity Content validity is the extend to which the D-score represents all facets of development. One way to investigate this is to evaluate to what extend the development domains are covered by the development scale. In contrast to “face validity”, which assesses whether the test appears valid to respondents, content validity is about what is actually measured. Each milestone can be assigned to a domain. Subsequently, the information that each milestone provides to the scale can be weighted by the domain representation. A visualistion of this information restuls in the following plot. 7.2.2 Construct validity Construct validity is the extend to which the D-score behaves like the theory says the construct should behave. An important aspect for development is that the D-score should increase by age. The Figure below shows that the D-score increases fastest in the first six months and keeps increasing, but slower, as children age. This is consistent with development theory. ## [[1]] "],
["external-validity.html", "7.3 External validity", " 7.3 External validity 7.3.1 Discriminatory validity With discriminatory validity, we indicate the extend to which the D-score can discriminate repondents that are not developing normally from respondents that are normally developing. This can be evaluated by deviding respondents for who we know that development lags as indicated by another measure, for example reflex and/or tonus problems in a population form Togo (Chapter 8). The D-score should be able to discriminate between these two types of respondents accurately. 7.3.2 Convergent validity Convergent validity is the extend to which the D-score relates to other similar constructs and can be measured as the correlation with another tests that is assumed to measure the same thing. This is similar to concurrent validity. For a good convergent validity the correlation to other construct should be at least 0.6. In the Figure below, the correlation of the D-score with .. are displayed. 7.3.3 Predictive validity Predictive validity refers to the degree to which the D-score predicts score on a criterion that is measured late rin time. For the D-score we have measures for IQ at the age of 5 as a possible criterion. Subsequently, for other examples we have other criteria. In Chapter 8, some examples are presented. "],

["d-score-of-reference-children-at-2-years-pd.html", "8.1 D-score of reference children at 2 years (PD)", " 8.1 D-score of reference children at 2 years (PD) A reference sample was obtained from the Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics (SMOCC) cohort, a nationally representative cohort of 2,151 children born in The Netherlands during 1988–1989 (Herngreen et al. 1994) . Of this cohort, general characteristics and developmental milestones of the Dutch Development Instrument at 2y of age (range 22-26 months) were available for 1,578 children. During the SMOCC study the milestones of the current wave and the next wave were assessed (Herngreen et al. 1994). With the SMOCC dataset we can compare the D-scores calculated by making use of calibrated milestones (the current wave milestones) with the D-scores calculated by making use of non-calibrated milestones (the next wave milestones). These D-scores for children of the age of 2 and 3 months (wave 2 and 3) are plotted against IQ at 5 years in figure 8.1. The continuous variable IQ at 5 years allows for nice visualization of the variation in D-scores. Moreover, the densities of the D-score are given at the bottom of the plots showing the distribution of the values of the D-score. Figure 8.1: Comparison of the D-scores calculated by calibrated and non-calibrated milestones at the age of 2 months (Wave 2) and 3 months (Wave 3) The colours of the dots in figure 8.1 indicate the number of negative scores on the milestones: note that the number of milestones can differ per wave. Wave 2 has two milestones, Wave 3 has five milestones and Wave 4 has six milestones of the DDI. The variation in the D-score of the children with the same number of negative scores (the same colour of dots) is caused by variation in age. Since the D-score is calculated by using an age-dependent prior, younger children in the same wave with the same scores will have a lower D-score. Moreover, the plots on the left in figure 8.1 show that using calibrated milestones leads to a gap between the green dots (zero negative scores) and the yellow dots (one negative score). Since 90% of the children should be able to get a positive score on each of the milestones implies that the milestones should be quite easy for the children of that age. So, when a child gets a negative score, it should have an impact on the D-score. For example, when a child of the age of 2 months has one negative score, his/her D-score immediately drops from around 20 to around 14. Which implicates that if you use the 2 month milestones for a child of the age of 2 months he/she will never have a D-score in the range of 15 - 18. This shows that it is also possible to have a ceiling/bottom within the D-score scale. This would be ideal in screening purposes, were you want to find children that have a delay in their development in comparison to their peers. In addition, the plots on the right in figure 8.1, show the D-scores when non-calibrated milestones (the milestones of the next wave) are used. For the DDI, on average, around 50% of the children should be able to get a positive score in this situation. For example, 50% of the children of the age of 2 months should be able to get a positive score on the 3 month milestones. Since these milestones are considered to be more difficult, a negative score on one of the milestones will have a smaller effect on the D-score. Hence, the gap we saw before between the green and yellow dots disappears. Furthermore, there is more variation in the D-scores and the ceiling/bottom within the D-score scale disappears. Previously described phenomena are also visible in the densities of the D-scores. When the D-scores are calculated with the calibrated milestones, the left plots in figure 8.1, the density consists (at least) of two (small) peaks. While the D-scores calculated with non-calibrated milestones, the plots on the right, show a broader variation in the values of the D-score. Note, that the density of the D-score in the plot on the bottom right also shows the bottom effect of the D-score: the D-score is at least equal to 20. A lower D-score is not possible with this set of milestones at the age of 3 months. Linear regression analyses were performed with DAZ as outcome and the indicators as predictors.

Developmental milestones can be assessed at several chronological ages (defined as age since birth, or postnatal age) to identify very preterm children who have developmental delay and who would benefit from stimulation programs. However, assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause overdiagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children and excessive referral for stimulation programs. Very preterm children may require additional time, determined by a factor that considers the difference between gestational age at birth (\\(GA_{birth}\\)) vs 40 wk (\\(GA_{birth}\\) for normal term birth), to enable development equivalent to that of normal term birth children. Several authors have proposed full or half correction of chronological age of very preterm birth children to provide a realistic evaluation of age-appropriate milestones; e.g. compare milestones for a child born at \\(GA_{birth}\\) 30 wk vs a normal term child when the chronological age is 10 (full correction, i.e. 40 minus 30 wk) or 5 wk (half correction, i.e. 40 minus 35 wk) lower for the term than very preterm child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) – a modification of the Gesell test – is used in preventive child health care to assess development from birth to chronological age 4 y. Data In 1983, data were collected for 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth (\\(GA_{birth} \\geq\\) 25 and &lt; 32 wk) or very low birth weight (birth weight &lt; 1500 g) (Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants [POPS]). Methods The \\(GA_{birth}\\) was determined from the best obstetric estimate, including last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. We evaluated development from birth to chronological age 2.5 y in 258 children who had very preterm birth (&lt;32 wk) and no handicaps such as retardation (3 or 4 months retarded or Developmental Quotient between 80 and 90), neurologic disorder, visual or hearing defects, or psychosocial problems. For the calculation of DAZ, the uncorrected and several corrected chronological ages were used according to the equation: Corrected chronological age (\\(d\\)) = uncorrected chronological age (\\(d\\)) - (\\(X_i × 7 × [40 - GA_{birth}(wk)]\\)) where the correction factor \\(X_i\\) ranged from full (\\(X_i = 1\\)) through half (\\(X_i = 0.5\\)) and no correction (\\(X_i = 0\\)). Development was considered equal to the general Dutch population when mean DAZ = 0. Results Mean DAZ \\(\\pm\\) SD for chronological age with correction by \\(X_i = 1.0\\) were: Uncorrected chronological age 19-26 wk: \\(0.67 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 32-40 wk: \\(-0.1 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 59-66 wk: \\(-0.1 \\pm 1\\); Uncorrected chronological age 111-119 wk: \\(0.1 \\pm 1\\).

Conclusions Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age 26 wk when chronological age was fully corrected, and fewer preterm children reached the milestones when uncorrected chronological age was used; fewer children reached the milestones when 0.5 correction for \\(GA_{birth}\\) was used, and similar proportions were observed when 0.75 correction for \\(GA_{birth}\\) was used within the first 26 weeks after birth. After chronological age 26 wk, similar proportions were observed between very preterm and full term children when chronological age was fully corrected for \\(GA_{birth}\\).

There is ample research indicating that the D-score actually is a valid indicator of development in western European countries like the Netherlands. If the D-score is a universal measure it should be informative in low and middle income countries as well. However, little is known about the usability and validity of the D-score in such countries. The aim of the present study is to examine the usability and validity of the D-score in the western African country of Togo. Togo definitely qualifies as a low income country with a 2017 GNI per capita of $610 versus $46,180 in the Netherlands, and $744 for low income countries in general (data.worldbank.org). To address this issue, we used data that were gathered by a French physician in Kpalimé, Togo. She set up a child health care system that was modeled after the Dutch preventive health care system. The system included the use of the so called Van Wiechen system to assess whether children’s developmental progress is in the normal range. The Van Wiechen data were used to calculate the D-scores as well as the age-corrected z-score of the D-score relative to a Dutch sample (DAZ). These two indices are the dependent variables in the present study. Data were gathered from about 9747 individuals in the 0-18 age range, but for the present study we focus on data from children in the 0-4 age range because the Van Wiechen assessment system is meant for this age range. Other available measures include father’s level of schooling, father’s number of children at the child’s first visit to the medical center, the APGAR score as a newborn, children’s weight, and the results of a physician’s neurological examination during visits to the health center. These variables are used to predict children’s D-scores and thereby to examine the D-score’s usability and validity in Togo. Methods Participants Participants potentially included 1859 children in the 0-4 age range who paid at least one visit to the Kpalimé health center. Kpalimé is the fourth biggest town in Togo, but the health center also attracted parents and children from a wide surrounding rural area. Parents visited the health center for several reasons, including for a preventive health check or because of their child’s apparent health problems. The possibility of visiting the health center was made known to parents by information sessions for parents at primary schools. Parents paid a small amount of money per visiting child (about €4 for children of 4 years or older, and €0.80 for children younger than 4 years). Because of limitations that are inherent to working in a low income country (limited access to the internet, computer failure) data of newly digitalized paper dossiers were sent to the Netherlands on a regular basis, but this practice unavoidably caused some unclarities and inconsistencies in the resulting dataset. Many of these could be solved, but time constraints prevented us from solving them all. Consequently, the data of .. potential participants (..%) were not yet included in the present study which leaves a dataset of 1659 (of 1644 NOG UITZOEKEN). Moreover D-scores could not be calculated when either age or Van Wiechen data were missing, which leaves a dataset of 2342 visits from 1522 children. The number of visits that parents of these children in the 0-4 age range paid to the health center varied from 1 – 9, but the majority of children were seen only once (n = 1146; 75.3%). Measures D-score D-scores were calculated based on a French-language version of the Van Wiechen assessment. As in the Dutch preventive health care system, the goal of administering the Van Wiechen assessment was to distinguish children with developmental problems from normal children. This means that items were chosen such that 90% of the children is expected to pass on age-equivalent items. Generally, for children that did not pass items age-equivalent items, extra items meant for a lower age were assessed (with the exception that items meant for children younger than 15 months were never administered to children of age 15 months or older). Scores were strictly based on observations rather than on parent report. For the exact procedure to calculate d-scores based on Van Wiechen-scores, see chapter .. Medical assessment At each visit a physician notated whether problems were observed regarding a wide renage of health aspects including problems with reflexes and muscle tension. Also, weight was measured at each visit. Background characteristics At the first visit of each child, the accompanying adult (mostly the mother) was asked to report on general background characteristics, including profession of the parents and the number of children each of the parents has (due to polygamy this number may differ between parents). As a measure of socio-economic status (SES) we constructed a dichotomous variable ‘schooling of father’ based on the reported profession of the father. As the main physician and founder of the medical center is familiar with the local culture and schooling system, she indicated which of the thirteen most common professions were likely to be schooled professions (i.e. need more than primary education). Fathers with one of these professions were classified as ‘schooled’. When ‘another profession’ was marked, the father was categorized as unschooled. Other background characteristics included gender of the child, number of children of the father at the moment of the first visit, and birth date. Age of the child at the moment of visiting was calculated based on the date of visit and the birth date. In Togo, medical information about a newborn is notated on a special card which parents receive. Parents were asked to take this card to the medical center; in this way information about the birth situation of part of the children was obtained, including birth weight, gestational age (&lt;37 weeks versus 37 weeks or more) and APGAR scores at 1, 5 and 10 minutes after birth. Procedure Measures used in this study were assessed at the medical center in Kpalimé which parents visited with their children, and were part of a general preventive health assessment (including physical measurements of weight, height, and head size, a medical examination, a few blood tests, and a hearing test). Also, parents were asked to report on characteristics of the birth situation, previous health issues, nutrition situation, and background characteristics of the family. During the visits, medical assessment took place before assessment of the Van Wiechen assessment, and was conducted by the same physician. All assessments, including the Van Wiechen assessment, were either performed by the initiating physician and founder of the medical center, or by one of three local physicians trained to assess the Van Wiechen procedure. Resulting data of the assessment (including advice given and/or references to another professional) were documented in paper dossiers and in 2017 digitalized by four local assistants via software program EpiData. Analyses To assess the validity of the D-score in this population, we inspected scatterplots in which d-scores are plotted against age for all available visits, and in which children with neurological problems as observed by a physician are highlighted. It was expected that a curve is seen, with higher d-scores for older children, moreover children with very low D-scores for their age were expected to be assessed by the physician as having a neurological problem. Validity and usability of the D-score in this population would also be supported when known risk factors of developmental problems would be found to be predictors of a lower D-score in this population as well. Risk factors of interest are health problems of a newborn (as indicated by a less than optimal APGAR score at 10 minutes), and being underweighted. Furthermore, if a relation between underweight and a lower D-score is observed, it would also be interesting to see whether there is a relation between family size and D-score, as many children per family could be a cause of malnutrition. For this purpose children were classified as being part of a large family when the number of children of their father was 5 or more (at the moment of their first visit) versus 4 or less. To assess which risk factors predict a lower than normal D-score, several regression analyses were conducted. Outcome variable is the Development - Age adjusted Z-score (DAZ) which tells how many standard deviations the D-score of the child deviates from his/her age mates. To calculate these z-scores, data of Dutch children are used as reference data. As this reference data is only available for children younger than age 2.78 years, only DAZ-scores could be calculated for age group 0 – 2.78, and therefore all regression analyses were performed for this subgroup. For some of the risk factor variables data is only available for part of the children. In order to prevent a loss of power, for each risk factor separate regression analyses were conducted. In each regression sex and education level of father (schooled versus unschooled) were added as covariates (except for the regression where the relation between large families and the DAZ is analyzed, as family size and schooling may be confounded). As data from visits of the same children are not independent, regressions were performed on data with one visit per child only. All regression analyses were conducted twice: once with the data from the first visit of each child, and once with the last visit of each child.

As expected, a curve is seen, with higher ages related to higher D-scores. Also, it can be seen that several D-scores are below the curve, i.e. these children had lower D-scores than their age mates. In figure .. it can be seen that many of these lower than normal D-scores are not artefacts of the data, but belong to children that were observed to have reflex and/or tonus problems. In figure .. underweighted children are highlighted. Visually there seems to be a relation between being underweighted and having a lower than normal D-score. A regression based on data of children&#39;s last visit showed that indeed the age-corrected weight z-score, after correction for fathers&#39; schooling and sex of the child, did predict the DAZ: a decrease of 1 SD in age-corrected weight was related to a decrease of `r round(regr10.3.weight_WHOz.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],1) ` SD in age-corrected D-score (p `r format.pval(regr10.3.weight_WHOz.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001) `), which is a reasonable effect. The overall model explained `r round(regr10.3.summary$adj.r.squared * 100,0)`% of the DAZ variance (adjusted R^2^). As in the other regression analyses sex and fathers&#39; schooling did not contribute significantly to the model. Because there clearly seems to be a relation between underweight and a lower than normal D-score, it was also tested whether family size (which might be a cause of malnutrition) did predict the DAZ. No such relation was found: children from large families (5 or more children of the father at the moment of the first visit versus 4 or less children) did not have different DAZ-scores at their last visit than children from smaller families (after correction for sex: B = `r round(regr6.2.no_of_children_father_dich5.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],2)`, p = `r format.pval(regr6.2.no_of_children_father_dich5.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001, digits=2)`, adjusted R^2^ = `r round(regr6.2.summary$adj.r.squared,3)`). &lt;!-- NOG CHECKEN: is het inderdaad 2zijdig getoetst? --&gt; In figure .. 1070 D-scores of 534 children for who a 10-minute APGAR score was available are shown. A less than optimal 10-minute APGAR score (i.e. less than 10 points) did predict a lower DAZ at their last visit after correction for sex and father&#39;s schooling (B = `r format(round(regr2.3.APGAR10min_dich10.coeff[&quot;Estimate&quot;],2), nsmall=2)`, p `r format.pval(regr2.3.APGAR10min_dich10.coeff[&quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;], eps = .001, digits=2)`, adjusted R^2^ = `r round(regr2.3.summary$adj.r.squared,3)`). So, children with a less than optimal APGAR score at ten minutes after birth, had somewhat lower D-scores. &lt;!-- NOG CHECKEN: waarom is df zoveel kleiner dan 534? Komt dat door &#39;laatste visit&#39;-selectie? --&gt; &lt;!-- en bij deze nog prematuriteit en evt. geb.gew toevoegen als covariaat? Kan dat dit vooral gaat over prematuur vs niet-prematuur # --&gt; For all regression analyses mentioned, results were similar when based on children&#39;s first visit. Discussion and conclusions In this study we examined the validity and usability of the D-score in low income country Togo. The D-score does seem to be informative in this country. The D-score did increase with age, and for the majority of the children D-scores were very similar within their age group. It is notable that there were also several children with much lower D-scores when compared with their age mates. This does not seem to be an artifact of the data or of the measures as the majority of these children were observed to have tonus and/or reflex problems. So, it is plausible that these children indeed had developmental problems. Furthermore, health factors that were expected to be related to having a lower D-score were found to be significant predictors: a less than optimal APGAR score 10 minutes after birth, and a lower than normal weight at the time of the assessment were related to a lower than normal D-score. Especially the relation between weight and D-score was quite strong, as the model with age-corrected weight, sex and father’s schooling explained 18% of the variance in age-corrected D-score. The positive relation between weight and D-score, as well as the fact that children were often underweighted in this population, seems to indicate that being underweighted is a risk factor for developmental problems. The main physician of the medical center noted that not many children with extreme underweight were seen, but our results do indicate that also less than severe underweight does have a negative impact on the development of children. The idea that having many children in the family would be related to having a lower D-score (due to possible malnutrition), was not supported. This might mean that there is no clear relation between living in a large family and being underweighted, or that we did not have enough power to detect this, as there were not that many children from large families. Neither sex nor father’s schooling did significantly contribute to variance in age-corrected D-scores. For sex at this young ages, this is consistent with results found in other studies (… refs…). Parents’ schooling has been found to be related to D-scores in other studies (… refs..), that it was not in the present study might have to do with the population, or with the current method where it was estimated whether the parent was schooled based on profession. Many fathers had a profession other than the thirteen most common professions and were estimated to have no schooling, which might not be correct for part of this group. A limitation of the present study is that our sample might not be representative of children in a low income country, or even of children in Togo. Especially the fact that many children came to the medical center because they were ill might mean that they are not representative in terms of general development and other measures. However, the current goal was to examine the validity and usability of the D-score in a low income country, and the result that, even though many children were ill, the D-score is clearly related to neurological problems (as indicated by reflex, and/or tonus problems), age, APGAR score as a newborn and weight does show that the D-score ís informative in a low income country as well. Evt nog doen: - Na overleg met Cécile Schat: zij zagen heel weinig echte ondervoeding; wel is lichaamsbouw daar zeer tenger; wat gebeurt er als je ipv ondergewicht ‘voedingstoestand geobserveerd door arts’ neemt als predictor? Betere indicator van ondervoeding is bovendien: specifieke vorm van bloedarmoede; die variabele zit er ook in; zegt ook iets over eenzijdig eten in plaats van simpelweg te weinig (volgens Cécile Schat komt eenzijdig wel veel voor; te weinig niet) - Gestational age en gebgewicht variabelen naar juiste dataset overhevelen zodat die ook gebruikt kunnen worden (GEDAAN; gebruiken om te laten zien dat verband APGAR-score niet verklaard wordt door prematuriteit?)

["predictive-power-of-d-score.html", "10.3 Predictive power of D-score", " 10.3 Predictive power of D-score To demonstrate the predictive power of the D-score, we will predict IQ at the age of 5 years for children in the SMOCC dataset. We have data for nine different waves, which includes different numbers of milestones of the Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI). See table 10.1 for an overview. Table 10.1: Overview of the nine waves of the SMOCC data Age in months Number of milestones of the DDI wave 1 1 5 wave 2 2 2 wave 3 3 5 wave 4 6 6 wave 5 9 7 wave 6 12 6 wave 7 15 6 wave 8 18 6 wave 9 24 6 First, we will plot the D-scores against IQ at 5 years for each of the waves (see figure 10.1). In this way, we can see the variation in D-scores for the different waves and how this relates to IQ at the age of 5 years. The colours indicate the number of milestones that got a negative score. Thus, for example, yellow indicates that one of the milestones got a negative score, however this does not mean that all yellow dots in the same plot represent the same number of positive scores. It could be that for some children not all scores of the milestones were available. The same holds, ofcourse, for the other colours as well. Figure 10.1: The D-scores plotted against IQ at 5 years for each wave In addition, it is important to note that the number of milestones per wave differ. For example, when we compare the plots for wave 8 and wave 9, it seems that at wave 8 the milestones are more difficult, since there are children who got a negative score on more than one milestone. While at wave 9, the maximum number of milestones with a negative score is one (yellow dots). However, wave 8 contains six milestones of the DDI, while wave 9 only contains one milestone of the DDI. Hence, the difference between the number of milestones at each wave causes the variation in the number of colours used between the nine plots. Furthermore, we can see that there is a gap between the cloud of blue dots and the cloud of yellow dots in all nine plots. Or in other words, there is a substantial difference in D-score between children without negative scores and childeren with (at least) one negative score on the milestone(s) of the DDI. The rational behind this, was explained in Chapter 8. For most of the waves there is no clear relation between the D-score and IQ at 5 years visible in the plots. However, for wave 7 and 9, we can see that the cloud of blue dots (with higher D-scores) lies a bit higher than the cloud consisting of the other dots. This could indicate that children with an higher D-score at the age of 15 months and 24 months also have an higher IQ at the age of 5 years on average. Besides the graphical exploration of the relation between the D-score and IQ at 5 years old, we can also use models to determine this relationship. For example, we can model IQ at 5 years old for each wave separately, which allows us to compare the effect of the D-score at each wave on the variation in IQ at 5 years. First, we can estimate models in which the D-score is the only explanatory variable for the variation in IQ at 5 years. The estimate for the D-score and the \\(R^2\\) of these nine models are visualized in figure 10.2. Figure 10.2: The estimate for the D-score and \\(R^2\\) plotted for each wave In figure 10.2, we can see that the estimates for the D-score and the \\(R^2\\) are the highest for wave 7 and wave 9. Indicating that the D-score at wave 7 and wave 9 has the largest effect on IQ at 5 years and explain the most variation in IQ at 5 years. In addition, figure 10.2 shows that the D-score of the first four waves barely explains any variation in IQ at 5 years. Thus, the D-scores of the first six months is not capable of explaining the variation in IQ at 5 years. Hence, the D-score when the children are older is better in explaining the variation in IQ at 5 years. Secondly, we can add explanatory variables to the regression model to control for confounding effects. For example, the education level of the mother can also partly explain the variation in IQ at 5 years, so it is important to add these to your prediction model. To predict IQ at 5 years, the following explanatory variables are added to the regression model: gender birthweight birthsize agemom: age mother edumocat: low, middle or high education level of the mother age D-score The first five variables are constant over the waves, while the other two variables vary over time. For each wave we have estimated two models, model 1 including all variables as listed above, and model 2 including all variables except for the D-score. Then, we can compare the explained variation of IQ at 5 years old of both models by comparing the adjusted \\(R^2\\). We have chosen for the adjusted \\(R^2\\) since it corrects for the number of variables added to the model: the \\(R^2\\) will always get higher when a new variable is added to the model. In this way, we can see how much of the variation in IQ is explained by adding the D-score to the regression model for each wave. The estimates for the predictor D-score, and it’s 95% confidence interval are given in table 10.2. Moreover, it contains the p-values for the predictor D-score in model 1 and the adjusted \\(R^2\\)’s for model 1 and model 2. The adjusted \\(R^2\\) determines the explained variation in the outcome measure, in this case IQ at 5 years, while penalizing for the number of predictors in the model. Comparison of the \\(R^2\\) is not feasible, since it will always increase when another predictor is added to the model.

In other words, the D-scores until the age of 1 year will not explain the variation in IQ at the age of 5 years. However, for wave 7, at the age of 15 months, the estimate for the D-score is just significant and explains almost 3% of the variation in IQ at the age of 5 years. There is also an almost significant effect of the D-score on IQ at waves 8 and 9, however this only explains around 0.5% of the variation in IQ at 5 years. "],
