## First 1000 days {#sec:first1000}

The *first 1000 days* refers to time needed for a child to grow from
conception to the second birthday. It is a time of rapid change.
During this period the architecture of the developing brain is very
open to the influence of relationships and experiences
[@skonkhoff2016best].

Early experiences affect the nature and quality of the brain’s
developing architecture by determining which synapses are reinforced,
and which are pruned through lack of use. During the first 1000 days,
brain architecture is basically shaped, but higher-order brain
functions still continue to develop into adolescence and early
adulthood [@kolb2017principles].

The classic *nature versus nurture debate* constrasts the viewpoints
that variation in development is primarily due to either genetic or
environmental differences. The current scientific consensus is that
virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic predisposition and
environmental differences [@rutter2007genes]. 

The environment in which a child develops (before and soon after
birth) provides experiences that can modify the expression of certain
genes [@caspi2010genetic]. Negative influences, such as exposure to
stressful life circumstances or environmental toxins, leave a
*chemical signature* on the genes.

During the first 1000 days, infants are highly dependent on their
caregivers to protect them from adversities and to help them regulate
their physiology and behavior. Caregivers can do this through
responsive care, including routines for sleeping and feeding. To reach
their developmental potential, children require nutrition, responsive
caregiving, opportunities to explore and learn, and protection from
environmental threats [@black2017early]. Gradually, children build
self-regulatory skills that enable them to manage stress as they
interact with their caregivers [@johnson2013science].


## Relevance of child development {#sec:relevance}

The first 1000 days is a time of rapid change. At the same time, significant disadvantages in the first 1000 days can undermine children’s development. In situations where caregivers are unable to protect and buffer their infants from adverse exposures, this can place an infant  at risk for mental health problems [@johnson2013science]. The physiological consequences of early adversities have been well documented and linked to difficulties with self-regulation and anxiety throughout childhood and adolescence [@burkholder2016early]. 

Young children who have been exposed to adversity or violence do not invariably develop stress-related disorders. They are at greater risk, but can also be helped substantially if reliable and nurturing relationships with supportive caregivers are established, and appropriate treatments are provided as needed [@belsky2002early]. An important protective factor for infants and young children in high-risk situations is a secure attachment to their caregivers. The adverse effects of cumulative risk and conditions of deprivation are reduced substantially by secure parent-child attachments [@sciaraffa2018understanding].

## Advantages and limitations of stunting {#sec:stunting}

Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the Child Growth Standards median. [FIGURE 1.4]  

Stunting caused by chronic nutritional deprivation in early childhood can be considered as an indicator of (poor) child development @perkins2017understanding. There is consistent evidence for the association between stunting and poor child development, despite heterogeneity in the magnitude of associations [@miller2016consistent; @sudfeld2015linear]. Linear growth in children is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age in comparison to normative growth standards [@wit2017practical]. Thus, considering impaired linear length as a ‘proxy measure’ for child development is eligible, in the sense that child development can be determined in a very simple way. Even in developing countries and deprived populations, anthropometric measures such as weight-for-age and height-for-age for children in the first two years are available.
However, using impaired growth as measure  for child development has also limitations. It is a physical indicator that does not take into account a direct evaluation of a child’s cognitive or mental performance. Second, the indicator can be flawed because measurements can be inaccurate. Third, there is considerable heterogeneity in how linear growth is measured in children all over the world. 



## Measuring neurocognitive development {#sec:neurocognitive}

Assessment of early neurocognitive development in children is challenging for many reasons [@ellingsen2016standardized]. During the first years of life developmental change occurs most rapidly, and the manifestation of different skills and abilities varies considerably for children.  Moreover, a child’s performance on a cognitive task is very susceptible to environmental and situational factors. [FIGURE 1.5]

Recently, a toolkit was published that reviews 147 assessment tools that have been developed
for children ages 0–8 years in low- and middle-income countries [@fernald2017toolkit]. The ideal child development assessment is easy to administer, has high reliability, validity, and cross-cultural appropriateness. It should also show variance in scores at different ages and ability levels. It will be no surprise that no test can meet all of these criteria. Many tests are too long, rather difficult to administer, and lack cross-cultural assessment of the reliability and validity.  The most widely used tools include the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Ages & Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), and  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).  None of these questionnaires can be considered as the ‘best’ child development assessment for children from different countries. We wonder if there is an alternative method to assess neurocognitive development in children?
