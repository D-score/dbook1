## First 1000 days {#sec:first1000}

The *first 1000 days* refers to time needed for a child to grow from
conception to the second birthday. It is a time of rapid change.
During this period the architecture of the developing brain is very
open to the influence of relationships and experiences
[@skonkhoff2016best].

Early experiences affect the nature and quality of the brain’s
developing architecture by determining which synapses are reinforced,
and which are pruned through lack of use. During the first 1000 days,
brain architecture is basically shaped, but higher-order brain
functions still continue to develop into adolescence and early
adulthood [@kolb2017principles].

The classic *nature versus nurture debate* contrasts the viewpoints
that variation in development is primarily due to either genetic or
environmental differences. The current scientific consensus is that
virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic predisposition and
environmental differences [@rutter2007genes]. 

The environment in which a child develops (before and soon after
birth) provides experiences that can modify the expression of certain
genes [@caspi2010genetic]. Negative influences, such as exposure to
stressful life circumstances or environmental toxins, leave a
*chemical signature* on the genes.

During the first 1000 days, infants are highly dependent on their
caregivers to protect them from adversities and to help them regulate
their physiology and behavior. Caregivers can do this through
responsive care, including routines for sleeping and feeding. To reach
their developmental potential, children require nutrition, responsive
care-giving, opportunities to explore and learn, and protection from
environmental threats [@black2017]. Gradually, children build
self-regulatory skills that enable them to manage stress as they
interact with their caregivers [@johnson2013science].


## Relevance of child development {#sec:relevance}

The first 1000 days is a time of rapid change. At the same time,
deprivation in the first 1000 days can seriously undermine the
developing child. In situations where caregivers are unable to protect
and buffer their infants from adverse exposures, this can place an
infant at risk for mental health problems [@johnson2013science]. The
physiological consequences of early adversities have been well
documented and linked to difficulties with self-regulation and anxiety
throughout childhood and adolescence [@burkholder2016early].

Young children who have been exposed to adversity or violence do not
invariably develop stress-related disorders. While they are at greater
risk, they can also be helped substantially if reliable and nurturing
relationships with supportive caregivers are established, and if
appropriate treatments are provided as needed [@belsky2002early].

An important protective factor for infants and young children in
high-risk situations is a secure attachment to their caregivers. The
adverse effects of cumulative risk and conditions of deprivation are
reduced substantially by secure parent-child attachments
[@sciaraffa2018understanding].

## Stunting as proxy for child development {#sec:stunting}

Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children
experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate
psycho social stimulation. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more
than two standard deviations below the Child Growth Standards median.
Stunting caused by chronic nutritional deprivation in early childhood
can be considered as an indicator of (poor) child development
[@perkins2017understanding].

```

(ref:shortkids) Seven eight-year old children standing in front of a wall
with the line depicting the average height according to the WHO Child
Growth Standards.

There is consistent evidence for the association between stunting and
poor child development, despite heterogeneity in the magnitude of
associations [@miller2016consistent; @sudfeld2015linear]. Linear
growth in children is commonly expressed as length-for-age or
height-for-age in comparison to normative growth standards
[@wit2017practical]. 

Considering impaired linear growth as a *proxy measure* for child
development is easy to do, and in fact quite common. Yet, using
impaired height growth as measure for child development is not without
limitations:

* The relation between height and child development is weak after
adjustment for age;

* Height is a physical indicator that does not take into account a
direct evaluation of a child’s cognitive or mental performance;

* There is considerable heterogeneity in heights of children all over
the world, and it is not clear how much of this variation is
attributable to differences in child development;

* Height is not sensitive to rapid changes in child development.

## Measuring neurocognitive development {#sec:neurocognitive}

Assessment of early neurocognitive development in children is
challenging for many reasons [@ellingsen2016standardized]. During the
first years of life developmental change occurs rapidly, and the
manifestation of different skills and abilities varies considerably
across children. Moreover, a child’s performance on a cognitive task
is very susceptible to measurement setting.

Recently, a toolkit was published that reviews 147 assessment tools
that have been developed for children ages 0–8 years in low- and
middle-income countries [@fernald2017toolkit]. The ideal child
development assessment is easy to administer, has high reliability,
validity, and cross-cultural appropriateness. It should also show
appropriate sensitivity in scores at different ages and ability
levels. It will be no surprise that no test can meet all of these
criteria. Many tests are too long, difficult to administer, lack
cross-cultural validity or have low reliability. In addition, many of
the measurement instruments are proprietary, and costly to use.

Some of the most widely used tools include the Achenbach Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID),
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Ages & Stages
Questionnaires (ASQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ), and the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DEN). 

Each of these tools has its strengths and limitations. For example,
the Denver is a relatively easy and quick to administer, but not very
precise. The Denver is therefore primarily applied as a screening tool
to pick up children who may need further attention. By contrast, the
BSID provides a clinical assessment at the individual level, and
requires a skilled professional to administer. Some instruments
collect observations through the caregiver (ASQ), whereas others
emphasize traits and behavior over performance (SDQ, CBCL). Moreover,
the age ranges to which the instruments are sensitive vary, as well as
the representation of different domains of development.

## Why this booklet? {#sec:why}

We believe that **there cannot be one instrument** for measuring child
development that is suitable for all situations. In general, the
instrument needs to be tailored to the setting. For example, in order
to establish whether an individual child is delayed in development, we
need an instrument that is precise for that individual child, and that
is sensitive to different domains of delay. In contrast, if we want to
estimate the proportion of children that is *developmentally on track*
in a country, we need one culturally unbiased, relatively imprecise
low-cost measurement made on many children across many ages, which we
then aggregate over all children in the country. The two instruments
that are optimal for these settings will look quite different.

We also believe that **there can be one scale** for measuring child
development, and that this scale is useful for many of applications.
Such a scale is similar to well-known scales for body height, body
weight or body temperature. Each scale has a clearly defined unit
(e.g., centimeters, kilograms, degrees Celcius). The measurements are
expressed as the number of scale units (e.g. 92 cm). Note that there
may be multiple instruments for measuring a child height (e.g. ruler,
laser distance meter, echo location, ability to reach the door handle,
and so on), but the result can always be expressed as the number of
scale units.

No measurement unit for child development yet exists. Currently, each
instrument defines its own scale, which renders the measurements made
by multiple instrument incomparable. It would certainly be an advance
if we would be able to tailor the measurement instrument to the
setting, while retaining the advantage that measurements from these
different instruments are values on a scale with the same unit. We can
then compare the data collected by different instruments. This booklet
explores the theory and practice for making that happen.

## Intended audience {#sec:audience}

We aim for three broad audiences:

* Professionals in the field of child growth and development;

* Policy makers in international settings;

* Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists.

Professionals in child development will become familiar with a new
approach to measure child development in early childhood. Our plan of
attack is to separate the measurement instrument from the scale used
to express the result. This formulation allows the user to **select the
instrument most suited for a particular setting**. Since instruments
differ widely in age coverage, length, administration mode, domain
coverage, and so on  (see @boggs2019), the ability to choose the
instrument, while not giving up comparability, represents a major
advance over routines that marry the scale to the instrument.

Policy makers in international settings wish to know the effect of
different interventions on child development. Gaining insight into
such effects is hampered by the fact that different studies use
different instruments. The ability to place measurements made by
different instruments onto the same scale allows for a **more accurate
understanding of policy effects**. It also allows to set priorities and
action levels that are less dependent on the way the data where
collected.

Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists generally prefer
numeric values with an unambiguous unit (e.g. centimeters, kilograms)
over a vector of dichotomous data points. This booklet shows how to
convert a series of PASS/FAIL scores to a numeric value with interval
scale properties. This opens up the way to the **application of
precise analytic techniques**, similar to those applied to child
height and body weight. The techniques have a solid psychometric
backing, and also apply to other types of problems.
