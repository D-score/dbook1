## First 1000 days {#sec:first1000}

The *first 1000 days* refers to time needed for a child to grow from
conception to the second birthday. It is a time of rapid change.
During this period the architecture of the developing brain is very
open to the influence of relationships and experiences
[@skonkhoff2016best].

Early experiences affect the nature and quality of the brain’s
developing architecture by determining which synapses are reinforced,
and which are pruned through lack of use. During the first 1000 days,
brain architecture is basically shaped, but higher-order brain
functions still continue to develop into adolescence and early
adulthood [@kolb2017principles].

The classic *nature versus nurture debate* contrasts the viewpoints
that variation in development is primarily due to either genetic or
environmental differences. The current scientific consensus is that
virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic predisposition and
environmental differences [@rutter2007genes]. 

The environment in which a child develops (before and soon after
birth) provides experiences that can modify gene activity
[@caspi2010genetic]. Negative influences, such as exposure to
stressful life circumstances or environmental toxins, may leave a
*chemical signature* on the genes, thereby influencing how genes
work in that individual.

During the first 1000 days, infants are highly dependent on their
caregivers to protect them from adversities and to help them regulate
their physiology and behavior. Caregivers can do this through
responsive care, including routines for sleeping and feeding. To reach
their developmental potential, children require nutrition, responsive
care-giving, opportunities to explore and learn, and protection from
environmental threats [@black2017]. Gradually, children build
self-regulatory skills that enable them to manage stress as they
interact with the world around them [@johnson2013science].


## Relevance of child development {#sec:relevance}

The first 1000 days is a time of rapid change. Early experiences
affect brain development and influence lifelong learning and health
[@skonkhoff2016best]. Healthy development is associated with future
school achievement, well-being and success in life [@bellman2013].

Professionals and parents consider it important to monitor children’s
development. Tracking child development enables professionals to
identify children with signs of potential delay. Timely identification
can help children and their parents to benefit from early
intervention. In a normal population, developmental delay affects
about 1--3\% of children. A delay in development may indicate
underlying disorders. About 1\% of children have an autism spectrum
disorder [@baird2006], 1--2\% a mild learning disability, and 5--10\%
have a specific learning disability in a single domain
[@horridge2011].

Children develop at different rates, and it is important to
distinguish those who are within the "normal" range from those who are
following a more pathological course [@bellman2013]. There is good
evidence that early identification and early intervention improve the
outcomes of children [@britto2017]. Early intervention is crucial for
children with developmental disabilities because barriers to healthy
development early in life impede development at each subsequent
stages.

Monitoring child development provides caregivers and parents with
reliable information about the child, and a opportunity to intervene
at an early age. Understanding the developmental health of populations
of children allows organisations and policymakers to make informed
decisions about programmes that support children’s greatest needs
[@bellman2013].

## Stunting as proxy for child development {#sec:stunting}

Stunting is the impaired physical growth and development that children
experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate
psycho social stimulation. Linear growth in children is commonly
expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age in comparison to
normative growth standards [@wit2017practical]. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO) children are defined as stunted if their
height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the Child
Growth Standards median. Stunting caused by chronic nutritional
deprivation in early childhood can be considered as an indicator of
(poor) child development [@perkins2017understanding].

include_graphics("fig/stuntedchildren.jpg")
```

There is consistent evidence for the association between stunting and
poor child development, despite heterogeneity in the magnitude of
associations [@miller2016consistent; @sudfeld2015linear]. Considering
impaired linear growth as a proxy measure for child development is
easy to do, and in fact quite common. Yet, using impaired height
growth as measure for child development is not without limitations:

* The relation between height and child development is weak after
adjustment for age;

* Height is a physical indicator that does not take into account a
direct evaluation of a child’s cognitive or mental performance;

* There is considerable heterogeneity in heights of children all over
the world;

* Height is not sensitive to rapid changes in child development.

## Measuring neurocognitive development {#sec:neurocognitive}

Assessment of early neurocognitive development in children is
challenging for many reasons [@ellingsen2016]. During the first years
of life developmental change occurs rapidly, and the manifestation of
different skills and abilities varies considerably across children.
Moreover, a child’s performance on a cognitive task is very
susceptible to measurement setting, timing and the health of the child
that day.

Recently, a toolkit was published that reviews 147 assessment tools
that have been developed for children ages 0--8 years in low- and
middle-income countries [@fernald2017toolkit]. The ideal child
development assessment is easy to administer and has high reliability,
validity, and cross-cultural appropriateness. It should also show
appropriate sensitivity in scores at different ages and ability
levels. It is no surprise that no test can meet all of these
criteria. Many tests are too long, difficult to administer, lack
cross-cultural validity or have low reliability. In addition, many of
the measurement instruments are proprietary, and costly to use.

Some of the most widely used tools include the Ages & Stages
Questionnaires (ASQ), Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL),
Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), Denver Developmental
Screening Test (DEN), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and its younger age
counterpart Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence
(WPPSI).

Each of these tools has its strengths and limitations. For example,
the ASQ and DEN are screeners for general child development. The CBCL
and SDQ are screeners for behavioral and mental health, not cognition
or general development. The Denver is a relatively easy and quick to
administer, but not very precise. The Denver is therefore primarily
applied as a screening tool to pick up children who may need further
attention. By contrast, the BSID provides a clinical assessment at the
individual level, and requires a skilled professional to administer.
Some instruments collect observations through the caregiver (ASQ),
whereas others emphasize traits and behavior over performance (SDQ,
CBCL). Moreover, the age ranges to which the instruments are sensitive
vary, as well as the representation of different domains of
development.

## Why this booklet? {#sec:why}

We believe that **there cannot be one instrument** for measuring child
development that is suitable for all situations. In general, the
instrument needs to be tailored to the setting. For example, in order
to establish whether an individual child is delayed in development, we
need an instrument that is precise for that individual child, and that
is sensitive to different domains of delay. In contrast, if we want to
estimate the proportion of children that is *developmentally on track*
in a country, we need one culturally unbiased, relatively imprecise
low-cost measurement made on many children across many ages, which we
then aggregate over all children in the sample. The optimal instrument
for each setting will look quite different.

We also believe that **there can be one scale** for measuring child
development, and that this scale is useful for many applications. Such
a scale is similar to well-known scales for body height, body weight
or body temperature. These scales have a clearly defined unit (i.e.,
centimeter, kilogram, degree Celcius), which moreover is assumed to be
constant across all scale locations. Measurements are expressed as the
number of scale units (e.g. 92 cm). Note that there may be multiple
instruments for measuring a child height (e.g. ruler, laser distance
meter, echo location, ability to reach the door handle, and so on),
but their result can all be expressed as the number of scale units (cm
here). The opposite is also true, and perhaps more familiar. We may
have one instrument and express the result in multiple units (e.g. cm,
inches, light years). 

**Instruments and scales are different things**. Currently,
instruments for measuring child development define their own scales,
which renders the measurements made by different instrument
incomparable. No measurement unit for child development yet exists. It
would certainly be an advance if we would be able to tailor the
measurement instrument to the setting, while retaining the advantage
that measurements from these different instruments are values on a
scale with the same unit. We can then compare the data collected by
different instruments. This booklet explores the theory and practice
for making that happen.

## Intended audience {#sec:audience}

We aim for three broad audiences:

* Professionals in the field of child growth and development;

* Policy makers in international settings;

* Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists.

Professionals in child development will become familiar with a new
approach to measure child development in early childhood. Our plan of
attack is to separate the measurement instrument from the scale used
to express the result. This formulation allows the user to **select the
instrument most suited for a particular setting**. Since instruments
differ widely in age coverage, length, administration mode, domain
coverage, and so on  (see @boggs2019), the ability to choose the
instrument, while not giving up comparability, represents a major
advance over routines that marry the scale to the instrument.

Policy makers in international settings wish to know the effect of
different interventions on child development. Gaining insight into
such effects is hampered by the fact that different studies use
different instruments. The ability to place measurements made by
different instruments onto the same scale allows for a **more accurate
understanding of policy effects**. It also allows to set priorities and
action levels that are less dependent on the way the data where
collected.

Statisticians, methodologists and data scientists generally prefer
numeric values with an unambiguous unit (e.g. centimeters, kilograms)
over a vector of dichotomous data points. This booklet shows how to
convert a series of PASS/FAIL scores to a numeric value with interval
scale properties. This opens up the way to the **application of
precise analytic techniques**, similar to those applied to child
height and body weight. The techniques have a solid psychometric
backing, and also apply to other types of problems.
