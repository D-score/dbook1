EXAMPLES OF AGE-BASED MEASUREMENT

Let the $Y_j$ contain the scores on the $j$-th developmental item, where $j = 1, \dots, p$. 
For the moment, let us assume that all items are binary, so that 
$Y_j = 0$ indicates a fail, and $Y_j = 1$ indicates a pass. 
Suppose we are interested in studing the relationship between age, denoted by 
variable $X$, and development as measured through items $Y_1, \dots, Y_p$.

The joint distribution $P(Y_1, \dots, Y_p, X)$ contains all relevant 
information for this problem. Age-based measurement is an attempt to model 
this joint distribution by breaking it down into $p$ conditional distributions:
$$
P(Y_1 | X)\\
\vdots\\
P(Y_p | X)\\
$$

each of which describes how the probability of passing changes with age. 
For example, @DRACHLER2007 formulated the model as a logistic regression 
model on the logarithm of age:

$$ 
\ln \frac{P(Y_j=1)}{P(Y_j=0)} = \alpha_j + \beta_j\ln X
$$

For this model, the age at which 50\% of the children pass item $j$ 
can be calculated as to $\exp(-\alpha_j/\beta_j)$. Since older children are 
expected to be more mature, this parameter is typically 
interpreted as the difficulty of the item. The slope parameter 
$\beta_j$ indicates how rapidly the probability of passing 
rises with age. Items with high $\beta_j$ have a great power to discriminate 
developmental status well within a small age range. It is straightforward
to calculate any other age-percentiles, for example, the ages 
at which probabilities 10\% or 90\% of the sample pass the item.
Table~2 in @DRACHLER2007 reports these statistics for the Denver 
developmental test.

While the idea of breaking up the test into separate items
is productive, age-based measurement has severe weaknesses. 

1. The concepts of age and development are not separated, so we 
cannot interpret the difficulty of an item without age. 
It would be more convenient, and conceptually clearer, if 
item difficulty could be a free-standing concept.

2. The models are fitted separately for each $Y_j$. Nothing 
is specified how the items relate to each other, so in principle, 
any variable that changes with age (e.g. child had first birthday) could 
qualify as a developmental item. It would be better of the 
procedure would start from a model about how the items should 
relate to each other. 

3. The intercept and slope estimates are dependent on 
the sample. A sample consisting of children of low ability
would give different estimates than a sample of children with
high ability. Calibration of test items is not person-invariant. 
It would be preferable if the difficulty estimates
were independent of the sample used to estimate them. 

4. Because of the introduction of slopes in the logistic model
a more able person may have a lower success probability for some
items than a less able person. It would be preferable if 
more able persons have a better succes rate on all items.
