# Quantifying child development {#ch:threeways}

> Author: Stef van Buuren

This section distinguishes three different principles that are being
used to quantify child development: 

* Age-based measurement (\@ref(sec:agebased))
* Probability-based measurement (\@ref(sec:probbased))
* Score-based measurement (\@ref(sec:scorebased))
* Unit-based measurement (\@ref(sec:unitbased))

## Age-based measurement of development {#sec:agebased}

### Motivation for age-based measurement

Milestones form the based building blocks for instruments to measure
child development. Methods to quantify development using separate
milestones typically relate the milestone behavior to the child's age.
@gesell1943 (p. 89) formulated this goal as follows:

> We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms
> of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait
> which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age.

There is a large literature that quantifies development in terms of
the ages at which the child is expected to show a specific behavior.
The oldest methods for quantifying child development calculate an *age
equivalent* for achieving a milestone, and compare the child's age to
this age equivalent.

### Age equivalent and developmental age {#sec:ageequivalent}

```{r milestonebased, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = '(ref:agebased)', warning = FALSE}
load(file = file.path("data/shirley.rda"))

d <- shirley %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, as.character(name))) %>%
  gather(key = "stage", value = "age", -name, -sex) %>%
  mutate(
    stage = factor(stage, unique(stage)),
    score = rep(1:4, each = 21))
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_point(cex = 3, pch = 1) + 
  geom_point() + 
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Stage")
```

(ref:milestonebased) Ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones. 

Figure \@ref(fig:milestonebased) graphs the ages at which each of the
21 children enters a given stage in Shirley's motor data of Table
\@ref(tab:shirley). Since `stepping` is followed by `standing`
children who can stand are older than the children who are stepping,
and hence more the ages for standing are plotted more to the right.

Since age and development are so intimately related, the *difficulty*
of a given developmental milestone is traditionally expressed in terms
of the *mean age* at which children achieve it. For example,
@stott1967 (p. 25) defines the *age equivalent* and its use for
measurement, as follows:

> The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age 
> at which children reach that particular stage. 

```{r agebox, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = '(ref:agebox)', warning = FALSE}
means <- aggregate(age ~  stage, d, mean)
ggplot(d, aes(y = age, x = stage, group = stage, colour = name)) +
  geom_boxplot(col = "skyblue", fill = "transparent", width = 0.3) +
  geom_point(cex = 3, pch = 1) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, colour = "black", geom = "point", 
               shape = 4, size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(y = "Age (weeks)", x = "Stage") +
  coord_flip()
```

(ref:agebox) Mean (symbol `x`) and spread of the ages at which 21 children achieve four motor development milestones.

Figure \@ref(fig:agebox) adds the mean age and the boxplot at which
the children enter the four stages. The difficulty of the stages can
thus be expressed as age equivalents: 16.1 weeks for `stepping`, 27.2
weeks for `standing`, 43.3 weeks for `walking with help` and 63.3
weeks for `walking alone`.

Thus, a child that is stepping beyond the age of 16.1 weeks is
considered later than average, whereas a child already stepping before
27.2 weeks is considered earlier than average. We may also calculate
age delta as the difference between the child's age and the norm age,
and express it as "two weeks late" or "three weeks ahead". Summarizing
age delta's over different milestones has led to concepts like
*developmental age* as a measure of a child's development.

### Limitations of age-based measurement 

Age-based measurement is easy to understand, and widely used in the
popular press, but not without pitfalls:

1. Age-based measurement requires us to know the ages at which the
child entered a new stage. The mean age can be a biased estimate of
item difficulty if visits are widely apart, irregular or missing.

2. Age-based measurement can inform us whether a child is achieving a
given milestone early of late. However, it does not tell is what
behaviors are characteristic for children of a given age.

3. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there
are no norms, we cannot quantify development.

4. Age-based measurement works only at the milestone level. Although
we may average age delta's over milestones, the selection of
milestones is arbitrary.

## Probability-based measurement {#sec:probbased}

An alternative is to calculate the *probability* of achieving a
milestone given the child's age, and compare the child's response to
that probability.

The passing probability is an easy to interpret and relevant measure.
An operational advantage of the approach is that the necessary
calculations places less demands on the available data, and can be
done even for cross-sectional studies.

(ref:shirleypa) Probability of achieving four motor milestones against age.

Figure \@ref(fig:shirleypa) plots the percentage of children passing
each of Shirley's motor milestones against age. There are four
cumulative curves, one of each milestone, that indicate the number of
children that pass the milestone. 

In analogy to the age equivalent introduced in Section
\@ref(sec:ageequivalent) we can define the *difficulty* of the
milestone as the age at which 50 percent of the children pass. In the
Figure we see that the difficulties are approximately 14.2 weeks
(`stepping`), 27.0 weeks (`standing`), 43.8 weeks (`walking with
help`) and 64.0 weeks (`walking alone`). In addition, we may easily
find the ages at which 10 percent or 90 percent of the children pass
each milestone.

Observe there is a gradual decline in the steepness as we move from
`stepping` to `walk_alone`. For example, we need an age interval of 13
weeks (33 - 20) to go from 10 to 90 percent in `standing`, but need 19
weeks (71 - 52) to go from 10 to 90 percent in `walking alone`. Thus,
one step on the age axis corresponds to different steps in
probability. The flattening pattern is typical for child development,
and represents clear evidence that development is faster at earlier
ages.

### Limitations of probability-based measurement

Probability-based measurement is a popular way to create instruments
for screening on developmental delay. For example, each milestone in
the Denver II [@frankenburg1992] has markers for the 25th, 50th, 75th
and 90th age percentile.

1. The same age step corresponds to different probabilities.

2. The measurement cannot exists without a norm population. When norms
differ, we cannot compare the measurements.

3. Interpretation is typically done at the milestone level, sometimes
supplemented by procedures for counting the number of delays. There is
no aggregate that takes all responses into account.

## Score-based measurement of development {#sec:scorebased}

### Motivation for score-based measurement {sec:motivscorebased}

Score-based measurement takes the responses on multiple milestones and
counts the total number of passed milestones as a measure of child's
development. This approach takes multiple measurements into account,
hence leading to a more stable measurement. 

One may order milestones in difficulty, and skip milestones that are
too easy, and stop administration when milestones become too
difficult. In such cases we cannot simply interpret the sum score of a
measure of development, and need to correct for the subset of
milestones that was actually administered. The usual working
assumption is that the child would have passed all easier milestones
and failed on all more difficult milestones. This procedure is
typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor, cognitive, and
so on.

### Example of score-based measurement

Figure \@ref(fig:scoreplot) is a gross-motor score calculated as the
number of milestones passed. It varies from 0 to 3.

```{r scoreplot, fig.asp = 0.6, fig.cap = '(ref:scoreplot)', warning = FALSE}
levels(d$stage) <- as.character(0:3)
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_step() + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ name, nrow = 3) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Gross-motor score")
```

(ref:scoreplot) Same data as in Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot), but now with 
the vertical axis representing gross-motor score.

The plot suggests that the difference in development between scores 0
and 1 is the same as the difference in development between, say,
scores 2 and 3. *This is not true*. For example, suppose that we
express difficulty of the milestone as an age-equivalent. From section
\@ref(sec:ageequivalent) we see that the difference in difficulty
between stepping and standing is 27.2 - 16.1 = 11.1 weeks, whereas the
difference between walking alone and walking with help is 63.3 - 43.3
= 20 weeks. Thus, according to age equivalents scores 0 and 1 should be 
closer to each other, and scores 2 and 3 should be drawn wider apart.

### Limitations of score-based measurement

Score-based measurement is today's dominant approach, but is not
without conceptual and logistical issues.

1. The total score depends not only on the (true) developmental status
of the child, but also on the set of milestones actually administered.
If a milestone is skipped or added, the sum score cannot be
interpreted anymore as a measure of the child's developmental status.
It might be possible to correct for starting and stopping rules under
the assumptions described in Section \@(sec:motivscorebased), but such
will be complicated if intermediate milestones are missing.

2. It is not possible to compare scores made by different instruments.
Some instruments allow conversion to age-conditional scores. However,
the sample used to derive such conversions are typically restricted to
one instrument, and does not extend to measurements made by other
instruments.

3. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive milestones tap
into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways
to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument.

4. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The
materials are often proprietary and costly.

## Unit-based measurement of development {#sec:unitbased}

### Motivation for unit-based measurement {#sec:motivationunit}

Unit-based measurement starts by defining the ideal properties of the
measurement, and derives a procedure to aggregate the responses on
milestones into an overall score that will meet the ideal.

Section \@ref(sec:questions) highlighted questions for individuals,
groups and populations. There are basically three questions:

* What is the difference in development over time for the same child,
group or population?

* What is the difference in development between different children,
groups or populations of the same age?

* How does child development compare to a norm?

In the ideal situation, we would like to have a continuous (latent)
variable $D$ (for development) that measures child development. The
scale should allow us to quantify *ability* of persons, groups or
populations from low to high. The scale should have a *constant unit*,
so that a given difference in ability refers to the same quantity
across the entire scale, just like that a difference of 10 cm is the
same irrespective of whether we compare the heights of books or the
heights of houses. When are these conditions are met, we say that we
measure on an *interval scale*.

If we succeed in creating an interval scale for child development, an
enormous arsenal of techniques developed for quantitative variables
opens up to measure, track and analyze child development. We may then
evaluate the development of a child in terms of $D$ points gained,
create age-dependent charts for development (just like growth charts
for height and weight), devise age-conditional measures for child
development, and intelligent adaptive testing schemes. Promising
studies on Dutch data [@jacobusse2006, @jacobusse2007, @vanbuuren2014]
suggest that such benefits are well within reach.

(ref:shirleypd) Modeled probability of achieving four motor milestones against the $D$-score.

Figure \@ref(fig:shirleypd) is similar to Figure \@ref(fig:shirleypa),
but with `Age` replaced by `Ability`. Also, the empirical curves have
been replaced by modeled curves, but this is not essential.

The ability values on the horizontal axis are estimated from the data
and correspond to the amount of development of each measurement.
Also, the logistic curves are estimated from the data, and reflect
the probability of passing each milestone at a given level of ability.

The figure shows that the probability of passing a milestone
increases with ability. Milestones are ordered in difficulty from left
to right. Milestone `stepping` is the easiest and `walk_alone` is most
difficult. The point at which a logistic curve crosses the 50 percent
line (marked by a cross) is customarily taken as the *difficulty of
the milestone*.

The increase in ability that is needed to go from 10 to 90 percent is
about five units here. Since all curves are parallel, the interval is
constant for all scale locations. Thus, the scale is an *interval scale*
with a *constant unit of measurement*. This is the type of measurement
scale needed for answering the basic questions identified in Section
\@ref(sec:motivationunit).

### Limitations of unit-based measurement

While unit-based measurement has many advantages, it cannot perform
miracles.

1. An important assumption is that the milestones "measure the same
thing", or put differently, are manifestations of an underlying
continuous latent variable that can be measured by empirical
observations. Unit-based measurement won't work if there is no
sensible latent scale.

2. The portrayed advantages hold only if the discrepancies between the
data and the model are relatively small. Since the simplest and most
powerful measurement models are very strict, it is important to assess
and increase the fit between data and model, for example by removing 
milestones that do not measure the underlying trait.

3. The construction of unit-based measurement requires psychometric
expertise, specialized computer software and considerable sample
sizes.

## A unified framework {#sec:whatismeasurement}

This section brings together the four approaches outlined in this 
chapter into a unified framework.

```{r lineplot, fig.cap = '(ref:lineplot)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/lineplot.png")
```
(ref:lineplot) Placing milestones and children onto the same line reveals their positions.

Figure \@ref(fig:lineplot) shows the imaginary positions on a
gross-motor continuum of three babies from Figure
\@ref(fig:shirleyplot) at the age of 30 weeks. Both milestones and
children are ordered along the same continuum. Thus, standing is more
difficult than stepping, and at week 30, Doris is ahead of Walley in
terms of motor development.

More generally, measurement is the process of locating milestones and
children on a line. This line represents a *latent variable*, a
continuous construct that defines the different poles of the concept
that we want to measure. A latent variable ranges from low to high.

The first part of measurement is to determine where the milestones are
located on the latent variable. In many cases, this part has already
been done for us. For example, each length marker on a ruler
corresponds to a milestone for measuring length. The manufacturer of
the ruler has already placed the marks at the appropriate places on
the ruler, and we take for granted that each marker has been
calibrated correctly.

A milestone for child development is similar to a length marker, but

* we often do not know how much development the milestone measures, so
its location on the line is unknown, or uncertain;

* we often do not know whether the milestone measures child
development at all, so it may have no location on the line.

The second part of measurement is to find the location of each child
on the line. For height this is easy. We place the horizontal head
piece on top of the child's head, and read off the closest height
marker. Since we lack physical ruler for development, we must deduce
the child's location on the line from the responses on a series of
well-chosen milestones.

By definition, a latent variable cannot be measured directly. However,
we may be able to actually measure variables (milestones) that are
related to the latent variable. For example, we may have the child's
scores on tasks like *standing* or *walking with help*.

The *measurement model* specifies the relations between the actual
measurements and the latent variable. Under a given measurement model,
we may estimate the locations of milestones and children on the line.
Section \@ref(sec:measurementmodel) discusses measurement models in
more detail.

: (\#tab:measurement) Evaluation of four measurement approaches on seven criteria.

&nbsp;

This chapter distinguished four approaches to measure child
development: *age-based*, *probability-based*, *score-based* and
*unit-based* measurement. Table \@ref(tab:measurement) summarizes how
the approaches evaluate on nine criteria.

*Age-based measurement* expresses development in age equivalents,
whose precise definition depends on the reference population.
Age-based measurement does not support multiple milestones, and does not
use the concept of a latent variable.

*Probability-based measurement* expresses development as age
percentiles with respect to a reference population. This type of
measurement is useful for individual milestones, but does not support
multiple milestones or a latent variable interpretation.

*Score-based measurement* quantifies development by summing the number
of passes. Different instruments make different selections of milestones,
so the measurements taken are unique to the instruments, so comparing
the measurement obtained by different instruments is difficult.
Corrections are needed if milestones are skipped or added.

*Unit-based measurement* defines a unit of measurement by a
theoretical model. When the data fit the model, we are able to
construct instruments that produce measurement in a common metric.
