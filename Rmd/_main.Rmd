## What is child development?

In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what
exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies
in the field [@SHIRLEY1931] was executed under the explicit aim 

> ... that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, 
> motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously.

Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these
domains of development.

```

baby achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Source:
@SHIRLEY1933.

Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure
\@ref(fig:shirley-motor) illustrates the various stages needed for
going from a *fetal posture* to *walking alone*. The ages are
indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in
timing between infants.

@GESELL1943 (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development:

> Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in
> an orderly sequence. Each stage represents a degree or level of
> maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing
> moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on.

Gesell's definition emphasizes that development is a continuous
process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of
maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves.

@LIEBERT1974 (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon
that unfolds in isolation.

> Development refers to a process in growth and capability over 
> time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with 
> the environment.

@CAMERON2012 (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows:

> "Growth" is defined as an increase in size, while "maturity" or 
> "development" is an increase in functional ability...The endpoint
> of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate 
> successfully ... not just biological maturity but also behavioral
> and perhaps social maturity.

@BERK2013 (p. 30) presented the emerging dynamic systems perspective on
child development as follows:

> Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, 
> and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions,
> each representing a different skill area that may undergo both
> continuous and stagewise transformation.

There are many more definition of child development. The ones given
here just illustrate the main points of view on child development.

## Theories of child development

The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic
disciplines. This very short overview therefore cannot do justice to
the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient
themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g.
@SANTROCK2010, @BERK2013), or by searching for the topic of interest
in an encyclopedia (e.g. @SALKIND2002).

The introductions by @SANTROCK2010 and @BERK2013 are surprisingly
consistent in distinguishing major theories in child development
according to their answer to three questions:

* *Continuous or discontinuous?*

Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process (Gesell) 
or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jump occurring 
from one stage to next other?

Several influential stage-based theories of human development have
been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by
psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by
Erikson [@ERIKSON1963], Kohlberg's six stages of moral development
[@KOHLBERG1984] and Piaget's cognitive development theory
[@PIAGET1969]. Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout
childhood. The first period, the *sensimotor period* (approximately
0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these
six stages describe the road to conceptual thought. Piaget's stages
are qualitatively differentiated, and aim to unravel the mechanism in
intellectual development.

* *One course or many?*

Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through 
the same set of stages. This assumption is explicit in the 
work of Gesell, who sees development as a more continuous process.

More recent ecological and dynamic systems theories posit that there
may be multiple ways to reach the same point. The path taken by a
given child will depend on the child's unique combination of personal
and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in
development.

knitr::include_graphics("fig/dynamic.png")
```

how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point 
using different paths. Source: @BERK2013.

* *Nature or nurture?*

Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing
development? Theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but
differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question
how to explain individual differences.

Maturation is the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course
of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that
differences in development are innate and stable over time. Others
argue that such differences are primarily driven by environmental 
factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child
development.

The answer --- if there is one --- in this stability-versus-plasticity
discussion has important practical consequences. If we believe that
differences are natural and stable, then it does not make sense trying
to change the conditions, as the impact on development will be
negligible. On the other hand, if we believe that development is
plastic, then intervening by high-quality programmes may have a
substantial pay-off in terms of improved development.


## Example of motor development

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pkg <- c("knitr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
loaded <- sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE, 
                 warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = "?")
```

For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in
the classic study on child development among 25 babies by
@SHIRLEY1931. Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of
the baby's walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out
a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room,
and lightly greases the soles of the baby's feet with olive oil. The
baby was invited to "walk" on the sheet. Of course, very young infants
need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by
graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were
repeated every week or bi-weekly.

```{r shirley, echo = FALSE}

  walk_help = c(21, 37, 25, 41, 37, 34, 45, 42, 41, 38,
  45, 45, 45, 49, 54, 46, 50, 45, 72, 54, 44),
  walk_alone = c(50, 50, 54, 54, 58, 60, 60, 62, 62, 64,
  66, 66, 66, 66, 68, 70, 70, 70, 74, 76, NA))
kable(shirley, 
      col.names = c("Name", "Sex", "Stepping", "Standing", 
                    "Walking with help", "Walking alone"))
```

: (\#tab:shirley) Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) 
for 21 babies [@SHIRLEY1931, Appendix 8].

Table \@tab:shirley lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when
they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and
walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark
in the first column the babies were already stepping when the
observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and
Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped
standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris
has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she
could walk alone.

```{r stepplot, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.6, fig.cap = '(ref:stepplot)'}
d <- shirley %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, as.character(name))) %>%
  gather(key = "stage", value = "age", -name, -sex) %>%
  mutate(
    stage = factor(stage, unique(stage)),
    score = rep(1:4, each = 21))
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_step() +

  theme_light() + 
  facet_wrap(~ name, nrow = 3) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Stage")
```

(ref:stepplot) Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby 
achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning.

Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) is a visual representation of the
information in Table \@ref(tab:shirley). Each data point is the age of
first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is
supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs,
there is a jump to the next level.

The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and
slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot 
children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry)
or who jump over stages (Martin, Max).

For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally
spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no
interpretation. In particular, the vertical distance does not tell us
how difficult it is to achieve the next stage. Instead, difficulty
corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction
between stages. For example, on average the line for `stepping` is
rather short in all plots, so going from `stepping` to `standing` is
relatively easy.

The figure presents information from only those visits where a jump
occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was
far higher. @SHIRLEY1931 actually collected data from 1370 visits,
whereas Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) plot just the 76 visits with jumps.
Thus, to obtain these individual curves the design has to be intense 
and costly.

## Age-based measurement of development {#agebased}

The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to
describe the behavior expected at a selected age. @GESELL1943 (p. 89)
formulates this goal as follows:

> We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms
> of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait
> which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age.

@STOTT1967 (p. 22) observed that it is impossible to define a scale
for measuring child development:

> When development appears as a change in kind, that is, when the 
> change consists of a series of qualitatively different events,
> or features, or "stages", it is not amemable to measurement
> by use of any standard scale of units.

As a solution Stott suggested using the "invariable sequence" of
successive stages as the basis for the assessment of the individual's
status. Stott argues that such sequences are fairly well established
for physical activity, but probably less so for the acquisition of
speech and other social skills.

Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of
developmental a given milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of
the age at which children achieve the milestone. For example,
@STOTT1967 (p. 25) defines the *age equivalent* and its use for
measurement, as follows:

> The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age 
> at which children reach that particular stage. A set of age 
> equivalents corresponding to a series of stages can be made to 
> function as a scale for individual assessment.

Alternatives to the age equivalents include the ages at which 10, 50
or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of
reasoning has led to the widely used concept of `developmental age` as
a measure of a child's development (in body size or motor skill or
psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms.

Age-based measurement was once the dominant paradigm for measuring child
development. However, it comes with some major problems and limitations.

1. Age-based measurement does not tell us what is normal for a child
at a given age. We can properly infer whether a child is early or late
for a given milestone. However, this does not mean that we may reverse
the direction of the inference, or conclude which behaviors are
characteristic for a given age without making further assumptions.

2. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there
is no norms, we cannot calculate development. Age-based measurement
intertwines the actual PASS/FAIL score with age norms.

3. Age-based measurement only works at the item level, and is 
cumbersome to apply with multiple items,

## Score-based measurement of development

As an alternative we may administer multiple items to the child, and
and compute the total number of PASS responses as a measure of child's
development. Items are generally ordered in increasing difficulty.
Items that are too easy are skipped, and very difficult items are not
administered, so in practice the interpretation of the sum score is
slightly more complicated. Most instruments describe corrections that
should be applied, and present the scores relative to a norm group.
Instruments usually contain different sets of items, each of which
measures a specific domains of development, and the administration is
repeated for each domain of interest.

Score-based measurement is the currently dominant approach, but has 
both conceptual and logistical issues.

1. The total scores calculated by different instruments are based on
different sets of items, and hence cannot be compared. In addition,
instruments use their own age norms, which also affects comparability.

2. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive items tap
into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways
to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument.

3. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The
materials are proprietary, and may be costly in research settings.

# Comparisons {#comparisons}

## Need for a unit of child development

Many disciplines study child development in order to answer clinical,
policy and public health questions. Typical questions at level of the
individual child include:

- What is the gain in development since the last measurement? 

- What is the difference in development between two children of the
same age?

- How does the child's development compare to a norm group?

- How will this child's develop further?

Studies aiming to identify determinant or establish effects typically
formulate questions at the group level. Examples are:

- What is the effect of an intervention on child development?

- What is the difference in child development between specific groups?

Monitoring population health is typically executed done at the
municipal, regional or country level. Relevant questions at these
levels include:

- What is the change in average child development since the last
measurement?

- What is the effect of different policies on child development?

- How does the population compare relative to a global standard for
child development?

Note that all questions compare the level of child development in some
way. A few questions compare development for the same
child/group/population at different ages. Some others compare
development within the same age across different children, group 
or populations.

In the ideal situation, we would have one unit for child development.
Let us name this unit *D*, for development. Unit *D* should have the
following desirable properties:

- Difference between two *D*-scores measured on the same child at
different ages quantifies the amount of development during the
interval

- Difference between the *D*-score measured on two different children
of the same age quantifies the difference in development between them

- Comparing the *D*-score to an age-dependent reference identifies
abnormal development

These properties will be satisfied if we measure development on an
interval scale, i.e., a scale with a constant unit. The interpretation
of the difference between two *D*-score is the same across the entire
scale, just like differences in height or weight. 

If we succeed in creating an interval scale for development, then an
enormous arsenal of technique developed for quantitative variables
opens up to measure, track and analyze child development.

## A new model for development

Chapter 2 reviewed the age-based and score-based approaches to the
measurement of child development. Neither approach provides a unit for
child development. Age-based measurement expresses development in
age-equivalents, whose precise definition depends on the reference
population. Score-based measurement measure by summing the number of
passes, but different instruments make different selections of items,
so the measurements are unique to the instruments, and cannot be
compared across instruments. Both approaches only provide arbitrary
measures.

In order to make progress, what we need is the definition of a unit of
child developent, and an operationalization how each measurement item
related to the unit. If we success in this, we are able to construct
different instruments that yields measurement in a common unit. The
next section introduce the basic concepts for this new approach.

### The latent variable, and its role in measurement

In this booklet we define measurement as the process of locating both
persons and items on a line that represents a *latent variable*. The
latent variable reflects the construct that the scale is designed to
measure. In our case, the concept is *child development*, but other
constructs, like *height*, *temperature* or *happiness* are equally
valid constructs.

A latent variable ranges from low to high, and preferably having a
constant unit so that the interpretation of a difference between two
scores is identical across the entire scale. A latent variable cannot
be measured directly. It is a theoretical construct. However, observed
(or manifest) variables can be measured. e.g., the child's scores on a
set of developmental items in a test.

The observed data may show typical patterns, like correlations, and
the idea is that these patterns can be explained by a single
underlying variable, the latent variable. The models that relate the
manifest variables to the latent variable express the probability of
passing a test item as a function of the difference between the
person's ability and the item's difficulty. Given the values on a set
of scores for a particular child and given a particular model, the aim
is to deduce the value on the latent variable which is most likely to
have given rise to the observed data.

### Criteria for invariant measurement

Measurement is the process of assigning numbers by rules to a set of
persons or objects. This definition is a little liberal. In order to
be useful the process of assigning numbers must be bound by some
imperatives. In this booklet, we strive to achieve *invariant
measurement*, a very strict form of measurements that is subject to
the following requirements (@ENGELHARD2013, p. 14):

1. *Item-invariant measurement of persons*: The measurement of persons
must be independent of the particular items that happen to be used for
the measuring.

2. *Non-crossing persons response functions*: A more able person must
always have a better chance of success on an item that a less able
person.

3. *Person-invariant calibration of test items*: The calibration of
the items must be independent of the particular persons used for
calibration.

4. *Non-crossing item response functions*: Any person must have a
better chance of success on an easy item than on a more difficult
item.

5. *Unidimensionality*: Items and persons must be simultaneously
located on a single underlying latent variable.

A statistical model that conforms to these five requirements is said
to be an *ideal-type model*. There are only very few ideal-type
models. An ideal-type model isn't changed to fit the data, but the
data (items and persons) are selected to fit the ideal-type model.

The need for the five requirements for invariance is not universally
shared. In particular, a substantial group of statisticians questions
the need for requirements 2 and 4, especially the words "always" and
"any", and may opt for more flexible models that do not strictly
adhere to the invariance conditions 2 and 4. There are also more
flexible models that assume a multi-dimensional instead of a
unidimensional latent variable. Some investigators question all
requirements, and would rather not be restricted and place a high
value to a good fit to all data.

### Item response functions

Let $\beta_n$ be the true (but unknown) developmental score of a child
at the time of measurement. The more generic term is the child's
*ability*. The *item response function* describes the probability of
passing an item as a function of ability. In general, we expect
that this probability increases with ability (requirement 2). Note
that this formulation differs from that given in Section
\@ref(agebased), where the probability was said to increase in age,
not ability. We will address this crucial difference in more detail in
Section \@ref(comparisonagebased).

```

(ref:irfplot) Item response functions for five hypothetical items,
each demonstrating a positive relation between ability and probability
to pass.

Ability and passing probability can be related in many ways. Figure
\@ref(fig:irfplot) illustrates the item response function of five
hypothetical test items A-E. Let us consider each of these function.

- A: Item A has step function, so all children with an ability < 1
logit fail, and all children with ability > 1 pass. This is the ideal
item for discriminating children that with abilities below and above 1
logit. The step function is widely used in sports. In a high-jumping
tournament, the bar is set very high in order to be able to
discriminate the best athletes. Note that the step function can only
test whether ability is below or above a specific level. It does
discriminate abilities at other levels.

- B: For item B, the probability of passing is constant at 30 percent.
This 30 percent is not related to ability. This item does not measure
ability, and only adds to the noise. It is a bad item for measurement.

- C: Item C has a smoothly increasing logistic function. If we know
ability $\beta$, the probability of passing can be calculate by the
standard logistic function $f(\beta) = e^\beta/(1+e^\beta)$. This
item can discriminate best around the point at which the probability
of passing is 0.5. The level is called the difficulty. Unlike the 
step function, this item can also discriminate abilities in the
neighborhood of the difficulty. 

- D: Item D is also a smoothly increasing logistic function, but it
has an extra parameter that allows it to vary its slope (or
discrimination). The extra parameter can be the item steeper (more
discriminatory) than the green curve, in the limit approaching a step
curve. It can also become shallower (less discriminatory) than the
green curve (as plotted here), in the limit approaching a constant
curve. Thus, item D is more general that items A, B or C.

- E: Item E is even more general in the sense that it need not be
logistic, but can be any monotonically increasing function. As
plotted, the item is insensitive to abilities between -1 and 0 logits,
and more sensitive to abilities of 0 to 2 logits.

These are just some examples of how the relation between the child's
ability and passing probability could look. In practice, the curves
need not start at 0 percent or end at 100 percent. They could also be
U-shaped, of have other non-monotonic forms. See @COOMBS1964 for a
thorough overview of such models. Here we restrict to increasing
functions so as to conform to invariance requirement 2.

### Person response functions

We now switch the roles of persons and items, and construct a function
that tells us how likely it is that a single person can pass an item, 
or more commonly, a set of items. 

<!-- Let $\delta_i$ be the true (but unknown) *difficulty* of an item. The -->
<!-- *person response function* is the probability that a single person passes  -->
<!-- each of a set items of varying difficulties.  -->

Let us continue with items A, C and D from Figure \@ref(fig:irfplot), and 
calculate the response function for three children, respectively with 
abilities $\beta_1 = -2$, $\beta_2 = 0$ and $\beta_3 = 2$.

(ref:prfplot) Person response functions for three children with abilities 
-2, 0 and +2, using a small test of items A, C and D.

Figure \@ref{fig:prfplot} presents the person response functions from
three persons with abilities of -2, 0 and +2 logits. The functions are
calculated as the average of response probabilities on items A, C and
D. Thus, on average, we expect that child 1 will pass an easy item of
difficulty -3 in about 60 percent of the time, whereas for an
intermediate item of difficulty of -1 the passing probility would be
10 percent. For child 3, with a higher ability, these probabilities
are quite different: 97% and 90%. The substantial drop in the middle
of the curve is caused by the step function of item A. 

Requirement 2 states that the success probability should be higher for
persons with a higher ability level. This is indeed the case here, but
there are also item response functions for which requirement 2 does
not hold.

### What is a test?

A set of items forms a test. The primary reason for administering a
test rather than a separate item is to improve the precision of the
measurement. The scores on the set of items (rather than the score on
a single item) can be combined into an overall score. Of course,
combining scores can only make sense if these items measure the same
underlying construct.

In principle, the five items A-E in Figure \@ref(fig:irfplot) could
form a test. This would not be an ideal test though, since this test
would violate requirement 4. We know that the difficulty of item A is
equal to +1 logits, and the difficulty of item C is 0 logits, so item
C is easier than item A. Requirement 4 says that persons should have a
higher chance of passing C. This is true indeed for persons having an
ability lower than +1 logits. However, for a person with ability +2
logits, the probability of passing A is higher than passing C, hence
requirement 4 does not hold for any test that holds both items A and 
C.


### Interval scale

The important property is that $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ are
all on the same scale, and hence can be compared in a sensible way. In
particular, suppose that $\beta_2 - \beta_1 = \beta_3 - \beta_2$, we
might say that the difference between ability $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
is the same the difference between abilities $\beta_2 - \beta_3$. This 
is the essential property of an interval scale.



### Family of item response theory models

*Ideal-type models*:

1. Guttman scalogram model (@GUTTMAN1950)

2. Rasch model (@RASCH1960) and extensions (@WRIGHT1982, @ANDRICH1988)

3. Mokken scaling model (@MOKKEN1971).

The Guttman and Mokken model yield an ordinal latent scale, while the 
Rasch model yields an interval scale (with a constant unit).


## Comparison to classic age-based approach {#comparisonagebased}

EXAMPLES OF AGE-BASED MEASUREMENT

Let the $Y_j$ contain the scores on the $j$-th developmental item, where $j = 1, \dots, p$. 
For the moment, let us assume that all items are binary, so that 
$Y_j = 0$ indicates a fail, and $Y_j = 1$ indicates a pass. 
Suppose we are interested in studing the relationship between age, denoted by 
variable $X$, and development as measured through items $Y_1, \dots, Y_p$.

The joint distribution $P(Y_1, \dots, Y_p, X)$ contains all relevant 
information for this problem. Age-based measurement is an attempt to model 
this joint distribution by breaking it down into $p$ conditional distributions:
$$
P(Y_1 | X)\\
\vdots\\
P(Y_p | X)\\
$$

each of which describes how the probability of passing changes with age. 
For example, @DRACHLER2007 formulated the model as a logistic regression 
model on the logarithm of age:

$$ 
\ln \frac{P(Y_j=1)}{P(Y_j=0)} = \alpha_j + \beta_j\ln X
$$

For this model, the age at which 50\% of the children pass item $j$ 
can be calculated as to $\exp(-\alpha_j/\beta_j)$. Since older children are 
expected to be more mature, this parameter is typically 
interpreted as the difficulty of the item. The slope parameter 
$\beta_j$ indicates how rapidly the probability of passing 
rises with age. Items with high $\beta_j$ have a great power to discriminate 
developmental status well within a small age range. It is straightforward
to calculate any other age-percentiles, for example, the ages 
at which probabilities 10\% or 90\% of the sample pass the item.
Table~2 in @DRACHLER2007 reports these statistics for the Denver 
developmental test.

While the idea of breaking up the test into separate items
is productive, age-based measurement has severe weaknesses. 

1. The concepts of age and development are not separated, so we 
cannot interpret the difficulty of an item without age. 
It would be more convenient, and conceptually clearer, if 
item difficulty could be a free-standing concept.

2. The models are fitted separately for each $Y_j$. Nothing 
is specified how the items relate to each other, so in principle, 
any variable that changes with age (e.g. child had first birthday) could 
qualify as a developmental item. It would be better of the 
procedure would start from a model about how the items should 
relate to each other. 

3. The intercept and slope estimates are dependent on 
the sample. A sample consisting of children of low ability
would give different estimates than a sample of children with
high ability. Calibration of test items is not person-invariant. 
It would be preferable if the difficulty estimates
were independent of the sample used to estimate them. 

4. Because of the introduction of slopes in the logistic model
a more able person may have a lower success probability for some
items than a less able person. It would be preferable if 
more able persons have a better succes rate on all items.

# Interpretation of item fit {#items} (IE)

## SMOCC data: design

To illustrate the interpretation of fit measures for the D-score we use the SMOCC study (Herngreen et al, 1993), which covers the age range 0-2 years. In the SMOCC study 57 items are asssesed to measure the D-score. 

```{r smocc data, include=FALSE}
smocc <- ddata::get_gcdg(study="Netherlands 1", adm = TRUE)

```


## Empirical and fitted item response curves

The fit of a Rasch model can be visually inspected by comparing the observed probability of endorsing an item to the fitted item response curve for endorsing the item. The fitted item response curve for each item $i$ is modeled as: $$E_{ni}= \frac{exp( \beta_{n} - \delta_{i} )}{1+exp(\beta_{n}-\delta_{i})}$$, where $\beta_n$ is the ability of person $n$ and $\delta_i$ is the difficulty of item $i$. In the Figure below, the item characteristics curve can be obverved for an example item "n5" and item "n38". It can be observed that for both items the observed data (orange line) fits nicely to the estimated item response curve (dashed line).  


```{r icc, include=FALSE}
smocc <- ddata::get_gcdg(study="Netherlands 1", adm = TRUE)
varlist <- dmetric::prepare_items(study = "Netherlands 1")
#equatelist <- dmetric::prepare_equates(varlist)

library(ltm)
 ltmrm <- ltm::rasch(smocc[,varlist$items])
 plotltm <- ltm::plot.rasch(ltmrm,type="ICC")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

## Item fit

The fit of the items evaluate the extent to which data performs with the construction of measurement. An assumption of the Rasch model is that items with a lower difficulty will always have a higher probability to pass in comparison to items with a higher difficulty level. Fit analysis evaluates the extend to which this is true for each item. Two types of item fit are distinguished: the item outfit and the item infit. The outfit evaluates the extent to which the responses to the items are consistent with the model. In other words wheter items with a lower difficulty also have a higher probability to pass. The outfit statistic is heavity infulenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlying, on-target, unexpected responses. 

To determine the fit of items to the model we compare the observed responses and the expected values. The observed response $x_{ni}$ of person $n$ on item $i$ can be $0$ or $1$. The expected response $E_{ni}$ is modelled as $$E_{ni}= \frac{exp( \beta_{n} - \delta_{i} )}{1+exp(\beta_{n}-\delta_{i})}$$. The difference between the observed and the expected responses are the residual errors. The item infit is the sum of the squared errors divided by the sum of the expected response variances $W_{ni}$. The expected response variance $W_{ni}$ can be obtained as $E_{ni}(1-E_{ni})$. The outfit is calculated as the sum of the squared standardizes errors. The residual errors are standardized by dividing by the expected binomial standard deviation: $$z_{ni} = \frac{x_{ni}-E_{ni}}{\sqrt{W_{ni}}}$$. Accordingly the infit and outfit are calculated as: $$Infit = \frac{\sum_{n}^N (x_{ni}-E_{ni})^2}{\sum_n^N W_{ni}}$$
   $$Outfit = \frac{\sum_{n}^N z_{ni}^2}{N}$$. 

## Item information at a given ability

The item information can be calculated as the amount of psychometric information an item contains for a given ability. The formula for the item information can be written as follows: $$I(\theta)=P_i(\theta)(1-P_i(\theta))$$, where $P_i(\theta)$ is the conditional probability of endorsing an item. 
The implications of the item information are first that the amount of infformation an item provides is maximized around the item-difficulty parameter.

# Interpretation of person fit {#persons} (IE)

## Empirical and fitted person response curves

## Person fit

The fit of the persons evaluates the extent to which the responses of any person conform to the Rasch model expectation. The Rasch model expects that a more able person has a greater probabilty to pass any item than a less able person. Fit analysis evaluates the extend to which this is true for any person. Two types of person fit are distinguished: the person outfit and the person infit. The outfit evaluates the extent to which the responses to of the persons are consistent with the model. In other words wheter persons with a lower ability also have a lower probability to pass items. The outfit statistic is heavity infulenced by outlying responses that do not fit the expected pattern. The infit is the information weighted fit and is more sensitive to inlying, on-target, unexpected responses. 

To determine the fit of persons to the model we compare the observed responses and the expected values. The observed response $x_{ni}$ of person $n$ on item $i$ can be $0$ or $1$. The expected response $E_{ni}$ is modelled as $$E_{ni}= \frac{exp( \beta_{n} - \delta_{i} )}{1+exp(\beta_{n}-\delta_{i})}$$. The difference between the observed and the expected responses are the residual errors. The person infit is the sum of the squared errors divided by the sum of the expected response variances $W_{ni}$. The expected response variance $W_{ni}$ can be obtained as $E_{ni}(1-E_{ni})$. The outfit is calculated as the sum of the squared standardizes errors accumulated over the items $L$ to evaluate the plausability of any person response. The residual errors are standardized by dividing by the expected binomial standard deviation: $$z_{ni} = \frac{x_{ni}-E_{ni}}{\sqrt{W_{ni}}}$$. Accordingly the infit and outfit are calculated as: $$Infit = \frac{\sum_{n}^L (x_{ni}-E_{ni})^2}{\sum_n^L W_{ni}}$$
   $$Outfit = \frac{\sum_{n}^L z_{ni}^2}{L}$$.

# Outcome {#outcome}

This chapter focusses on the first application of the D-score: the D-score as neurocognitive outcome at 1000 days. In this chapter, we show how the D-score is calculated, demonstrate how to work with the D-score package, and how the D-score can be used as neurocognitive outcome in three different populations. First, the calculations behind the D-score are explained step-by-step and how to do this with the D-score package by means of two example children. Thereafter, the D-scores will be calculated for three different populations at the age of two years: the reference population, population of preterm children, and population of children in LMIC. 


## Application I: D-score as neurocognitive outcome at 1000 days

In the Netherlands, development of children is monitored by using the Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI; in Dutch: Van Wiechenschema). The DDI consists of 76 items and a subset of these items are assessed at different ages, ranging from 1 month to 4.5 years old. To explain how the D-score is calculated and demonstrate the use of the D-score package two example children, both of the age of 15 months, are used. One of the example children is able to do all items of his/her age, and the other example child is not able to do all items of his/her age. In this way, we can show how different scores on a item affect the D-score.

So for example, for a child of the age of 15 months the Dutch Developmental Instrument consists of the following six items: puts cube in and out of a box, plays 'give and take', crawls (abdomen off the floor), walks along, understands a few words, and says 2 'sound-words' with comprehension. For each of these six items it is noted whether the child was able to perform this item. An example of the results can be found in table \@ref(tab:tableWS), in which *child 1* was able to perform all items and *child 2* was able to perform four of the six items. Based on these scores we can calculate the dscore for both these children.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
child1 <- c(15/12, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
child2 <- c(15/12, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)
tableWS <- rbind(child1, child2)
colnames(tableWS) <- c("age in years", "item 1", "item 2", "item 3", "item 4", "item 5", "item 6")
rownames(tableWS) <- c("child 1", "child 2" )
#item2 : speelt geven/nemen
#item6 : loopt langs
```

```{r, tableWS, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(tableWS, caption = "Example of scores on the items of the DDI at the age of 15 months", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Calculation of the D-score is an iterative procedure, in which in each step information of one item is added. The iterative procedure uses Bayes rule to update the prior (knowledge) with data to calculate a posterior. In the next step, this posterior is used as the prior and information, the score, from a new item is added. This results in a new posterior distribution. When the information of all items have been added to the procedure, the D-score is equal to the mean of the final posterior distribution. 

*!!plafond prior nog uitleggen!!*

In the first step, the score of the first item is combined with the prior. However, at the first step we cannot use the previous posterior as our prior. Hence, we need a starting distribution to use as the prior in the first step. It is important that this starting distribution is a bit informative but not too much, so it was decided to choose a quite broad distribution which was centred quite well. The prior was chosen in such a way that the mean value of the prior distribution was equal to the median D-score at that age. The standard deviation is equal to 5, which about twice the normal variation in the D-score.

The starting distributions (priors) for the ages of 1, 15 and 24 months are given in figure \@ref(fig:figpriors). This figure shows that the priors assume that ability of a child of the age of 1 month is lower than the ability of a child of the age of 15 months, which in turn is lower than the ability of a child of the age of 24 months. 

```{r, figpriors, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap="\\label{fig:figpriors} Priors at ages of 1, 15 and 24 months"}
library(dscore)
#example from the adp function:
qp <- -10:80
plot(x = qp, y= adp(1/12, qp), type = "l", 
  main = "Priors at ages of 1, 15 and 24 months", 
  ylab = "Density", xlab = "D-score")
lines(x = qp, adp(1.25, qp), lty = 2)
lines(x = qp, adp(2, qp), lty = 3)
```

First, it is important that the names of the items used are similar to the names of the items in the built-in item bank. In this example the lexicon *gcdg* is used. Moreover, the data should be in long format with the following columnnames: *items*, *scores* and *ages*. This leads to table \@ref(tab:tablenewWS1).

```{r, tablenewWS1, echo=FALSE}
WS1 <- data.frame(child = c("child 1", "child 1", "child 1", "child 1", "child 1", "child 1", "child 2", "child 2", "child 2", "child 2", "child 2", "child 2"),items = c("n32", "n33", "v38", "n37", "n34", "n35", "n32", "n33", "v38", "n37", "n34", "n35"), scores = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0), ages = c(15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12, 15/12))

kable(WS1, caption = "Long format of the example of scores on the items of the DDI at the age of 15 months", row.names = NA)
```

Now that the data is in long format and the item names are changed to the lexicon *gcdg*, we can calculate the D-score for both children. In the first step of the iterative procedure, we combine the age-dependent prior of 15 months with the score of the first item *n34* to define the posterior. Item *n34* is a gross motor item: 'crawls, abdomen off the floor'. In table \@ref(tab:tablenewWS1), we can see that both example children were able to crawl with their abdomen off the floor. Note, that we could have chosen any of the items as the first item, since the D-score is independent of the order of items in the calculation. 

The age dependent prior of 15 months and the posterior distribution after adding information from item *n34* are given in figure \@ref(fig:fig1item). In this figure, we can see that the posterior distribution doesnot differ that much from the prior distribution. Both distributions are centred at the same point, while the posterior distribution is smaller than the prior distribution indicating more precision. Since both example children were able to crawl with their abdomen off the floor, the posterior distribution after the first step of the procedure is equal. 

```{r, fig1item, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1item} Age-dependent priors of 15 months and posterior after 1st item n34"}
items <- c("n34")
age <- 1.25
  
#full posterior 1e item
fp <- dscore(1, items, age, full = TRUE, lexicon = "gcdg")
plot(fp[[1]]$qp, fp[[1]]$posterior, type = "l", lty = 1,
xlab = "D-score", ylab = "Density", 
main = "Age 15 months: 1 PASS at n34")
lines(fp[[1]]$qp, fp[[1]]$start, lty = 2)
legend(0.04, 0.08, c("posterior", "prior"), lty = c(1, 2), 
       merge = TRUE)
```

Now, let's add an item on which the scores for the two example children differ, e.g. item *n35*. Item *n35* is also a gross motor item, namely 'walks along'. So both children are able to crawl (with their abdomen of the floor), but only *child 1* is able to walk along. We can use the previously calculated posterior distribution as prior when we add item *n35*. 

Let's start with *child 1*, who is able to walk along. Using Bayes rule, the new posterior distribution can be calculated. In figure \@ref(fig:fig2itemC1) the prior, in this case the posterior after adding item *n34* to the age-dependent prior, and the newly calculated posterior distribution are visualized. Again, the posterior and prior are centred around the same point, while the posterior has a bit more precision.

```{r, fig2itemC1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig2itemC1} Prior and posterior in the 2nd step of the iterative process for child 1"}
items <- c("n34", "n35")
age <- rep(1.25, length(items))
  
#full posterior 2e item
fp2 <- dscore(c(1,1), items, age, full = TRUE, lexicon = "gcdg")
plot(fp[[1]]$qp, fp2[[1]]$posterior, type = "l",
xlab = "D-score", ylab = "Density", 
main = "Age 15 months: PASS at n34 and n35 (child 1)", col = "red")
lines(fp[[1]]$qp, fp[[1]]$posterior, lty = 2)
legend(0.04, 0.08, c("posterior child 1", "prior"), lty = c(1, 2), 
       col = c("red","black"),merge = TRUE)

```

Now we can do the same thing for *child 2*, who is able to crawl with his/her abdomen off the floor (*n34*) but not to walk along (*n35*). Again, we can use the posterior after adding information from *n34* as the prior and use the information from *n35* to calculate the posterior. In figure \@ref(fig:fig2itemC2) the prior and posterior are given. Now the prior and posterior are different, the posterior is on the left of the prior and has an high precision in comparison to the prior. Hence, being unable to walk along at the age of 15 months, like *child 2*, is more indicative for the development of a child of 15 months than being able to walk along like *child 1*. 

```{r, fig2itemC2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig2itemC2} Prior and posterior in the 2nd step of the iterative process for child 2"}
items <- c("n34", "n35")
age <- rep(1.25, length(items))
  
#full posterior 2e item FAIL
fp2 <- dscore(c(1,0), items, age, full = TRUE, lexicon = "gcdg")
plot(fp[[1]]$qp, fp2[[1]]$posterior, type = "l",
xlab = "D-score", ylab = "Density", 
main = "Age 15 months: PASS at n34 and FAIL at n35 (child 2)", col = "blue")
lines(fp[[1]]$qp, fp[[1]]$posterior, lty = 2)
legend(0.15, 0.23, c("posterior child 2", "prior"), lty = c(1, 2), 
       col = c("blue","black"),merge = TRUE)

```


The next four steps in the iterative procedure, information from the other four items (*n32*, *n33*, *v38* and *n37*) can be added in a similar fashion. Figure \@ref(fig:fig6itemC1C2) shows the final posterior distributions for *child 1* and *child 2* and the prior distribution for the age of 15 months. The D-score can now be determined by looking at the mean of the posterior distributions. Hence, the D-score for *child 1* and *child 2* are equal to 55.75 and 47.76, respectively.

```{r, fig6itemC1C2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig6itemC1C2} Prior and final posterior for child 1 and 2"}
items <- c("n32", "n33", "v38", "n37","n34", "n35")
age <- rep(1.25, length(items))
  
#full posterior for both children and prior
fp6_1 <- dscore(c(1,1,1,1,1,1), items, age, full = TRUE, lexicon = "gcdg")

## D-score of reference children at 2 years (MG)

**Data**

A reference sample was obtained from the Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics (SMOCC) cohort, a nationally representative cohort of 2,151 children born in The Netherlands during 1988–1989 [@herngreen1994growth] . Of this cohort, general characteristics and developmental milestones of the Dutch Development Instrument at 2y of age (range 22-26 months) were available for 1,583 children. 


**Statistical analyses**

Several characteristics were selected from the SMOCC cohort.  The following indicators are in agreement with the Global Indicators Project:

- Area of residence:
    - rural: <2,000 inhabitants
    - semi-urban: [2000, 50,000] inhabitants
    - urban: 50,000 – 1 million inhabitants
    - metropolitan: >1 million

-	Number of years of education by the mother (in years)
-	Child related factors:
     - Gestational age (In weeks and in categories of very preterm (<32 weeks), preterm (<37 weeks) and term birth (≥37 weeks))
     - Gender (boys vs girls)
     - Birthweight (in grams)
     -	Birth size (in cm) 


We also added the following indicators from the SMOCC study:

-	Paternal education (in years)
-	Maternal age (in years)
-	Apgar score after 1 min < 5 (yes vs no)
-	Apgar score after 5 min < 7 (yes vs no)

## D-score of pre-terms at 2 years (PD)

Developmental milestones can be assessed at several chronological ages (defined as age since birth, or postnatal age) to identify very preterm children who have developmental delay and who would benefit from stimulation programs. However, assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause overdiagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children and excessive referral for stimulation programs. Very preterm children may require additional time, determined by a factor that considers the difference between gestational age at birth ($GA_{birth}$) vs 40 wk ($GA_{birth}$ for normal term birth), to enable development equivalent to that of normal term birth children. Several authors have proposed full or half correction of chronological age of very preterm birth children to provide a realistic evaluation of age-appropriate milestones; e.g. compare milestones for a child born at $GA_{birth}$ 30 wk vs a normal term child when the chronological age is 10 (full correction, i.e. 40 minus 30 wk) or 5 wk (half correction, i.e. 40 minus 35 wk) lower for the term than very preterm child. The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) – a modification of the Gesell test – is used in preventive child health care to assess development from birth to chronological age 4 y.


**Purpose**

To investigate the effect of correcting chronological age for $GA_{birth}$ on DDI scores in very preterm infants with no handicaps.


**Methods**

In 1983, data were collected for 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth ($GA_{birth} \geq$ 25 and < 32 wk) or very low birth weight (birth weight < 1500 g) (Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants [POPS]). The $GA_{birth}$ was determined from the best obstetric estimate, including last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. We evaluated development from birth to chronological age 2.5 y in 258 children who had very preterm birth and no handicaps such as retardation (3 or 4 months retarded or Developmental Quotient between 80 and 90), neurologic disorder, visual or hearing defects, or psychosocial problems. From birth to chronological age 2.5 y, the DDI included 57 developmental milestones covering 3 domains of child development: fine motor activity, adaptive, and personal/social behavior; communication; and gross motor activity. The DDI was administered by a trained health care professional, and 5 to 9 milestones were evaluated at each health care visit. The child was scored as having passed/reached (was able to perform the milestone at the visit) or failed the milestone (unable to perform). Development score (D-score) was determined from an algorithm that summarized these developmental milestones into a single aggregate score measuring global development. The LMS method was used to transform the D-score to a z-score (DAZ) according to references for development in the Dutch population. For the calculation of DAZ, the uncorrected and several corrected chronological ages were used according to the equation:

Corrected chronological age ($d$) = uncorrected chronological age ($d$) - ($X_i × 7 × [40 - GA_{birth}(wk)]$)

where the correction factor $X_i$ ranged from full ($X_i = 1$) through half ($X_i = 0.5$) and no correction ($X_i = 0$). 
Development was considered equal to the general Dutch population when mean DAZ = 0. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between $GA_{birth}$ and milestones that were assessed at 2 consecutive visits. 


**Results**

Mean DAZ $\pm$ SD for chronological age with correction by $X_i = 0, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1.0$ were:

-	Uncorrected chronological age 19-26 wk: $-2 \pm 2, -0.7 \pm 1, 0 \pm 1$, and $+0.7 \pm 1$;
-	Uncorrected chronological age 32-40 wk: $-2 \pm 1, -1 \pm 1, -0.5 \pm 1$, and $0 \pm 1$;
-	Uncorrected chronological age 59-66 wk: $-1 \pm 1, -0.6 \pm 1, -0.3 \pm 1$, and $-0.1 \pm 1$;
-	Uncorrected chronological age 111-119 wk: $-0.4 \pm 1, -0.1 \pm 1, 0 \pm 1$, and $0.1 \pm 1$.

In 12 of 18 milestones from all 3 domains, there was a significant positive association between $GA_{birth}$ (25-31 wk) and the proportion of children reaching the milestone after adjustment for uncorrected chronological age. No significant association was observed after adjustment for full correction of chronological age.


**Conclusions**

Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age 26 wk when chronological age was fully corrected, and fewer preterm children reached the milestones when uncorrected chronological age was used; fewer children reached the milestones when 0.5 correction for $GA_{birth}$ was used, and similar proportions were observed when 0.75 correction for $GA_{birth}$ was used within the first 26 weeks after birth. After chronological age 26 wk, similar proportions were observed between very preterm and full term children when chronological age was fully corrected for $GA_{birth}$. We recommend 0.75 correction of chronological age before uncorrected chronological age 26 wk and full correction for uncorrected chronological age 26 to 119 wk.
