This section compares child development between samples from three different studies:

-   *SMOCC*, a representative sample of Dutch children (\@ref(sec:smoccstudy))
-   *POPS*, a cohort of all Dutch preterms in 1983 (\@ref(sec:pops))
-   *TOGO*, a set of medical records from preventive health service in Togo (\@ref(sec:togo))
-   A summary of the main findings (\@ref(sec:threestudiesconclusions))

Each study used the same measurement instrument, the DDI (see Section \@ref(sec:ddi)). The section compares D-scores between studies.

(ref:smoccda9) Distribution of D-score and DAZ by child age in a cohort of Dutch children aged 0-2 years (Source: SMOCC data, $n$ = 2151, 9 occasions).

Figure \@ref(fig:smoccda9) shows the D-score distribution by age in the SMOCC data. The grey curves represent references calculated from the SMOCC data. The top figure illustrates that rise of the D-score with age, whereas the bottom chart shows that the DAZ distribution covers the references well.

The ceiling effect causes low coverage after the age of 24 months. There are also less prominent ceiling effects for younger children. Without these effects, the references would presumably show some additional variation.

(ref:popsda9) Distribution of D-score and DAZ by child age in a cohort of preterm aged 0-2 years. Ages are corrected for preterm birth by a factor of 0.75 (Source: POPS data, 450 children, four occasions).

Figure \@ref(fig:popsda9) presents the D-score and DAZ distributions for the POPS cohort of children born very preterm or with very low birth weight. The distributions of the D-score and DAZ are similar to those found in the SMOCC study.

Since the D-scores are calculated using the same milestones and difficulty estimates as used in the SMOCC data, the D-scores are comparable across the two studies. When the milestones differ between studies (e.g. when studies use different measurement instruments), it is still possible to calculate D-scores. This problem is a little more complicated, so we treat it in Chapter II.

The primary new complication here is the question whether it is fair to compare *postnatal age* of children born at term with postnatal ages of very preterm children. This section focuses on this issue in some detail.

### POPS design

In 1983, the Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants (POPS study) collected data on all 1338 infants in the Netherlands who had very preterm birth (gestational age \< 32 weeks) or very low birth weight (birth weight \< 1500 grams). See @verloove1986 for details.

The POPS study determined gestational age from the best obstetric estimate, including the last menstrual period, results of pregnancy testing, and ultrasonography findings. The POPS study collected measurements on 450 children using the DDI at four visits at corrected postnatal ages of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

### Age-adjustment

Assessment of very preterm children at the same chronological age as term children may cause over-diagnosis of developmental delay in very preterm children. Very preterm children may require additional time that allows for development equivalent to that of children born a term.

In anthropometry, it is common to correct chronological age of very preterm born children to enable age-appropriate evaluation of growth. For example, suppose the child is born as a gestational age of 30 weeks, which is ten weeks early. A *full correction* would deduct ten weeks from the child's postnatal age, and a *half correction* would deduct five weeks. In particular, we calculate the corrected age (in days) as:

$$
\mathrm{corrected\ age} = \mathrm{postnatal\ age}\mathrm{\ (days)} - f \times [280 - \mathrm{gestational\ age\ (days)}],
$$

where 280 is the average gestational age in days, and where we specify several alternatives for $f$ as 1.00 (full correction), 0.75, 0.50 (half) or 0.00 (no correction).

Let's apply the same idea to child development. Using *corrected age* instead of *postnatal age* has two consequences:

-   It will affect the prior distribution for calculating the D-score;
-   It will affect DAZ calculation.

We evaluate these two effects in turn.

### Effect of age-adjustment on the D-score

```{r adjustd, fig.cap = '(ref:adjustd)'}
g <- ggplot(subset(pops2, n > 0), 
            aes(x = d_0.00, y = d_1.00, 
                colour = cut(f, breaks = c(-1, 0, 1, 35),
                             labels = c("0", "1", "2+")))) + 
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "grey") +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  labs(colour = "Number of fails") +
  xlab("D-score (postnatal age)") +
  ylab("D-score (full age adjustment)") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.15))
g
```

(ref:adjustd) Scatterplot of two versions of the D-score, one calculated using postnatal age ($f = 0.00$), the other calculated using full age-adjustment ($f = 1.00$).

Figure \@ref(fig:adjustd) plots the fully age-adjusted D-score against the unadjusted D-score. Any discrepancies result only from differences in the ages used in the age-dependent prior (c.f. Section \@ref(sec:adp)).

All points are on or below the diagonal. Age-adjustment lowers the D-score because a preterm is "made younger" by subtracting the missed pregnancy duration, and hence the prior distribution starts at the lower point. For example, the group of red marks with D-scores between 30$D$ and 40$D$ (age not corrected) will have D-scores between 20$D$ and 30$D$ when fully corrected. Note that only the red points (with perfect scores) are affected, thus illustrating that the prior has its most significant effect on the perfect response pattern. See also Section \@ref(sec:startingprior). The impact of age-correction on the D-score is negligible when the child fails on one or more milestones.

### Effect of no age adjustment ($f = 0.00$) on the DAZ

```{r popsda90, fig.cap = '(ref:popsda90)', fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE}
pops2$agemos <- pops2$age_c0.00 * 12
plot_ddaz(pops2, y = "d_0.00", z = "daz_0.00", 
          xlab = "Postnatal age (in months)", 
          colour = "#006CC2B3")
```

(ref:popsda90) Distribution of D-score and DAZ without age correction for preterm birth ($f = 0.00$).

Figure \@ref(fig:popsda90) illustrates that a considerable number of D-scores fall below the minus -2 SD line of the reference when age is not adjusted, especially during the first year of life. The pattern suggests that the apparent slowness in development is primarily the result of being born early, and does not necessarily reflect delayed development.

### Effect of full age adjustment ($f = 1.00$) on the DAZ

```{r popsda91, fig.cap = '(ref:popsda91)', fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE}
pops2$agemos <- pops2$age_c1.00 * 12
plot_ddaz(pops2, y = "d_1.00", z = "daz_1.00", 
          xlab = "Age (in months), fully corrected", 
          colour = "#006CC2B3")
```

(ref:popsda91) Distribution of D-score and DAZ under full age correction for preterm birth ($f = 1.00$).

Full age correction has a notable effect on the DAZ. Figure \@ref(fig:popsda91) illustrates that the POPS children are now somewhat advanced over the reference children. We ascribe this seemingly odd finding to more prolonged exposure to sound and vision in air. Thus after age correction, development in preterms during early infancy is advanced compared to just-born babies.

Full age correction seems to overcorrect the D-score, so it is natural to try intermediate values for $f$ between 0 and 1.

```

:::

<br>

Table \@ref(tab:tabz) compares mean DAZ under various specifications for $f$. Values $f = 0.00$ and $f = 0.50$ do not correct for preterm birth enough in the sense that all sign are negative. In contrast, $f = 1.00$ overcorrects. The value of 0.73 is implausibly high, especially because this value is close to birth. Setting $f = 0.75$ seems a good compromise, in the sense that the average DAZ is close to zero in the first age interval. The average DAZ is negative at later ages. We do not know whether this genuinely reflects less than optimal development of very preterm and low birth weight children, so either $f = 1.00$ and $f = 0.75$ are suitable candidates.

### Conclusions

-   Compared with the general population, more very preterm children reached developmental milestones within chronological age five months when chronological age was fully corrected;
-   Fewer preterm children reached the milestones when chronological age was not corrected;
-   Fewer children reached the milestones when we used a correction of $f = 0.50$;
-   Similar proportions were observed when we used $f = 0.75$ within the first five months after birth.
-   After chronological age five months, we observed similar proportions for very preterm and full-term children when chronological age was fully corrected.
-   We recommend using full age correction ($f = 1.00$). This advice corresponds to current practice for growth and development. As we have shown, preterms may look better in the first few months under full age-correction. If the focus of the scientific study is on the first few months, we recommend an age correction of $f = 0.75$.

(ref:togoda) Distribution of D-score and DAZ by child age of children living near Kpalimé, Togo (Source: TOGO data, $n = 1567$).

Figure \@ref(fig:togoda) presents the D-score and DAZ distributions of a sample of children living near Kpalimé, Togo. While the primary trend with age conforms to the previous data, the distributions differ from those in Figures \@ref(fig:smoccda9) and \@ref(fig:popsda9) in two respects:

-   *Compression at the upper end*: Most of the D-scores are above the median curve, which suggests that, at these ages, children living in Togo *develop faster* than children living in the Netherlands;
-   *Expansion at the lower end*: There is a considerable variation in D-scores on the lower end, with many D-scores below the -2 SD curve, suggesting that some children are *significantly more delayed* than would be expected in both Dutch samples.

The D-scores are calculated using the same 57 milestones and difficulty estimates as before. The resulting D-score distribution is quite unusual. The main question here is what could explain the pattern found in the D-scores. This section explores this question in some detail.

### Togo Kpalimé study, design

If the D-score is to be a universal measure, then it should be informative in *low and middle-income countries* (LMIC) as well. We do not yet know much about the usability and validity of the D-score in LMIC's. The western African country of Togo qualifies as a low-income country, with a 2017 GNI per capita of USD 610, compared to USD 46,180 in the Netherlands, and USD 744 for low-income countries in general (data.worldbank.org).

The data were collected by Cécile Schat-Savy, who initiated a youth health care centre modelled after the Dutch youth health care system in Kpalimé, Togo. See <https://www.kinderhulp-togo.nl> for more background. Data monitoring included a french translation the DDI for measuring child development. The investigators gathered data from 9747 individuals in the 0-18 age range.

Participants include children and their parents who visited the Kpalimé health centre at least one time. Kpalimé is the fourth largest town in Togo, but the health centre also attracted parents and children from a wide surrounding rural area. Parents visited the health centre for several reasons, including for a preventive health check or because of their child's apparent health problems.

The health centre targeted parents through information sessions for parents at primary schools. Parents paid a small amount of money per child (about USD 4.00 for children of 4 years or older, and USD 0.80 for children younger than four years). Four local data-assistants, some portrayed on Figure \@ref(fig:dataassistents), digitized the data from paper archives. TNO Child Health in The Netherlands monitored the process and checked the data for completeness and consistency.

Here we use a subset of 2674 visits from 1644 unique children who scored on the 57 milestones of the DDI 0-2 years. We did not calculate D-scores when age or DDI milestones were missing, which left a dataset of 2425 visits from unique 1567 children. The number of visits varied from 1 -- 9. The majority of children visited the centre once.

### D-score labelled by neurological problem {#sec:togoneuro}

```{r togoda1, fig.cap = '(ref:togoda1)', fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
togo2$cohort <- "TOGO: Marked by presence of neurological problem"
plot_da(togo2, v = "neuro", colour = "#009E73B3")
```

(ref:togoda1) Distribution of D-score by age labelled by neurological (tonus and/or reflex) problems. (Source: TOGO data).

Figure \@ref(fig:togoda1) is the same scatter plot as in Figure \@ref(fig:togoda), but now marked by whether the physician registered signs of neuropathology in the form of tonus and reflex problems.

Many children with low D-scores also have tonus or reflex problems. This finding alone suggests that extreme D-score are not artefacts (e.g. caused by a wrongly coded age), but indicate main adverse health conditions.

### D-score labelled by Apgar score

```{r togoda2, fig.cap = '(ref:togoda2)', fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
togo2$cohort <- "TOGO: Marked by Apgar (10 min) < 8"
plot_da(togo2, v = "apgar", colour = "#009E73B3")
```

(ref:togoda2) Distribution of D-score by age labelled by Apgar score (10 minutes) lower than 8. (Source: TOGO data).

Figure \@ref(fig:togoda2) identifies the children who had an Apgar score at 10 minutes after birth that was lower than 8. About half of these children had a D-score below -2 SD curve.

### D-score labelled by severe underweight

```{r togoda3, fig.cap = '(ref:togoda3)', fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
togo2$cohort <- "TOGO: Marked by severe underweight (WAZ < -4)"
plot_da(togo2, v = "underweight", colour = "#009E73B3")
```

(ref:togoda3) Distribution of D-score by age labelled by severe underweight (WAZ \< -4) (Source: TOGO data).

Many children who visited the Kpalimé health centre had a low body weight for their age. Figure \@ref(fig:togoda3) marks the subset of severely underweight children (WAZ \< -4). A substantial proportion of these children also had a very low D-score.

### D-score labelled by severe stunting

```{r togoda4, fig.cap = '(ref:togoda4)', fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
togo2$cohort <- "TOGO: Marked by severe stunted growth (HAZ < -4)"
plot_da(togo2, v = "stunted", colour = "#009E73B3")
```

(ref:togoda4) Distribution of D-score by age labelled by severe stunting (HAZ \< -4) (Source: TOGO data).

Figure \@ref(fig:togoda4) is similar to \@ref(fig:togoda3), but now marked by the subset of severely stunted children (HAZ \< -4). Also here, a sizable proportion has a low D-score.

When taken together, Figures \@ref(fig:togoda1)-\@ref(fig:togoda4) show that children with very low D-scores often experience (multiple) harsh health problems. Those health problems may have substantially delayed their development.

### Gross motor development

```{r grossmotor, fig.cap = '(ref:grossmotor)', fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots[[1]], plots[[2]], plots[[3]], ncol = 1)
#
```

(ref:grossmotor) Gross motor milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones.

Figure \@ref(fig:grossmotor) shows substantial differences in gross motor development between children from Togo and the Netherlands. For example, at the age of three months, about 30 per cent of the Dutch infants succeed in controlling their head when pulled to sitting. However, infants from Togo seem already capable of head control when they are just one month old.

Moreover, the advantage persists at least until up to the age of two years: children in Togo can roll over and sit much earlier, or kick a ball without falling. As the documentary [Babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB36k0hGxDM) shows, African children even manage to learn to walk with a tin can on their head, a craft that children in the west never achieve.

### Fine motor development

```{r finemotor, fig.cap = '(ref:finemotor)', fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots[[4]], plots[[5]], plots[[6]], ncol = 1)
```

(ref:finemotor) Fine motor milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones.

Figure \@ref(fig:finemotor) shows a less pronounced but similar phenomenon for fine motor skills. These data suggest that children in Togo may have better fine motor skills than the children from the two Dutch cohorts.

### Communication and language

```{r commun, fig.cap = '(ref:commun)', fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots[[7]], plots[[8]], plots[[9]], ncol = 1)
```

(ref:commun) Communication and language milestones. Probability by age for SMOCC, POPS (corrected age) and TOGO studies for three milestones.

Figure \@ref(fig:commun) summarizes the data for three milestones on communication and language. In general, the success probability is similar in the three studies.

One curious finding is that the high proportion of milestones passes in `ddicmm041` for the Togo children around the age of 18 months. Note that several of the green lines in Figures \@ref(fig:grossmotor)-\@ref(fig:commun) start close to perfect scores, which makes it impossible to show the rising patterns found in the Dutch data.

It may indeed be true that children from Togo develop more rapidly than Dutch children. But we may also wonder: Could there just be reporting bias on the part of the parents who either do not understand the items or have the expectation to say "yes" even if the child can't do it? It would be desirable if these results could be backed up from other sources.

## Conclusions {#sec:threestudiesconclusions}

This section compared the D-scores estimated from the DDI administered to three different groups of children.

We found that

-   The D-score by age plot showed a positive, curved relationship with age in all three studies;
-   Children born very preterm or with very low birth weight had similar development to reference children when their age was corrected for early birth;
-   A relatively small subset of children born in Togo had extremely low D-scores, not found in the Netherlands, likely the result of underlying neuropathology, severe underweight or severe stunting;
-   On average, children from Togo seemed to have faster development during the first two years, especially in motor development, though there may be issues with reporting bias.

All in all, these findings support the usefulness and validity of the D-score as an informative summary of child development during their first two years of life.
