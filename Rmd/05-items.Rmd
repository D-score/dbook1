# Interpretation of item fit {#items}

## SMOCC data 

### Design

The Social Medical Social Medical Survey of Children attending Child
Health Clinics (SMOCC) was initiated to obtain reference data on
morbidity in Dutch children in their first two years of life. During
1988 and 1989, the staff of 21 Child Health Clinics (CHC) (in Dutch:
Consultatieburo) recorded data on the pre-and perinatal period and on
the first two years of life of infants born in the geographically
defined catchment areas of these clinics. The CHC is a free service
run by the government that is attended by over 95% of all children
born in The Netherlands. The CHC vaccinates the infants, tracks their
growth and development, signals health problems, provide advice and,
where needed, refers infants to specialist care. The SMOCC cohort is
representative for the newborn population of the Netherlands with
respect to mother's age at delivery, parity and, to a somewhat lesser
extent to the level of maternal education and degree of urbanization
of residential area.

The CHC records retrospective data on pregnancy and delivery during a
home visit by district nurses of the CHC about 2-3 weeks after
delivery. The CHC offers 9 follow-up visits during the first two years
scheduled at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 18 and 24.

The number of children admitted in the study was $n$ = 2151 children.
The design of the study is documented by @HERNGREEN1992. The original
data forms can be found in @HERNGREEN1993. @HERGREEN1994 studied
patterns in longitudinal growth for children aged 0-2 years.

### Developmental data

```{r ddi, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:ddi)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/wiechen-dutch.png")
```

(ref:ddi) The Dutch Development Instrument for infants aged 0-15 
months. The gray staircase pattern indicates items that are too 
difficult for the age. Scores are made in the white cells with
a plus (+) and minus (-) indicating pass and fail, respectively. 
The difficulty of the items is chosen such that 90% of the children 
can perform the task at the age indicated. Source: @LAURENT2008.

The Dutch Development Instrument (DDI) (Dutch: Van Wiechenschema) 
consist of a set of developmental items on fine motor, gross motor,
language development and social behavior domain. Figure 
\@ref(fig:ddi) displays the form used in the regular CHC to track 
child's development. @LAURENT2008 provides extensive background
on how to administer, score and interpret the results (in Dutch). 
Only a handful of items is examined in each visit.

### Example

```{r smocc-load, echo = FALSE}
load("data/smocc.rda")
```

The `smocc` dataset contains the responses on each items and for each
child. The dataset has `r nrow(smocc)` rows and `r ncol(smocc)`
columns. The first six records are:

```{r smocc-dim}
head(smocc)
```
