### A unit for development

The measures in child growth are well-establish physics units, whereas
the measures in child development are more arbitrary and specific to
the instrument. While it is hard to create a truly physical analogue
of a unit that will measure child development, we can imagine one, as
follows:

* Assume that a milestone has an inherent difficulty that is the same
for all populations.

* The distance between the difficulty levels of two of such milestones
is therefore also constant for all populations.

* That distance defines a *unit of development*. Note that we can
define a unit for any pair of milestones.

The $D$-score unit is just one choice for a unit. This choice is no
less, and no more, arbitrary than the choice of some standard physical
rod for the unit of length. The real crucial assumption that the
difficulties, i.e., the begin and end points of the rod, are identical
in all populations.
