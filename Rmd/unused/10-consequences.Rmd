# Consequences {#consequences}

This chapter focuses on the third application of the $D$-score: the long-term health consequences of delay in development in pre-terms. In this chapter, we explain the relevance of long-term health outcomes and show how the D-score can be used to predict these long-term health outcomes. In addition, we present the practical implications and how this leads to new opportunities and show the impact of early intervention.
