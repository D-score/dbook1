# Short history

## What is child development?

In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what
exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies
in the field [@SHIRLEY1931] was executed under the explicit aim 

> ... that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, 
> motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously.

Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these
domains of development.

```

baby achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning. Source:
@SHIRLEY1933.

Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure
\@ref(fig:shirley-motor) illustrates the various stages needed for
going from a *fetal posture* to *walking alone*. The ages are
indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in
timing between infants.

@GESELL1943 (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development:

> Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in
> an orderly sequence. Each stage represents a degree or level of
> maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing
> moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on.

Gesell's definition emphasizes that development is a continuous
process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of
maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves.

@LIEBERT1974 (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon
that unfolds in isolation.

> Development refers to a process in growth and capability over 
> time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with 
> the environment.

@CAMERON2012 (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows:

> "Growth" is defined as an increase in size, while "maturity" or 
> "development" is an increase in functional ability...The endpoint
> of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate 
> successfully ... not just biological maturity but also behavioral
> and perhaps social maturity.

@BERK2013 (p. 30) presented the emerging dynamic systems perspective on
child development as follows:

> Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, 
> and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions,
> each representing a different skill area that may undergo both
> continuous and stagewise transformation.

There are many more definition of child development. The ones given
here just illustrate the main points of view on child development.

## Theories of child development

The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic
disciplines. This very short overview therefore cannot do justice to
the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient
themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g.
@SANTROCK2010, @BERK2013), or by searching for the topic of interest
in an encyclopedia (e.g. @SALKIND2002).

The introductions by @SANTROCK2010 and @BERK2013 are surprisingly
consistent in distinguishing major theories in child development
according to their answer to three questions:

* *Continuous or discontinuous?*

Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process (Gesell) 
or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jump occurring 
from one stage to next other?

Several influential stage-based theories of human development have
been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by
psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by
Erikson [@ERIKSON1963], Kohlberg's six stages of moral development
[@KOHLBERG1984] and Piaget's cognitive development theory
[@PIAGET1969]. Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout
childhood. The first period, the *sensimotor period* (approximately
0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these
six stages describe the road to conceptual thought. Piaget's stages
are qualitatively differentiated, and aim to unravel the mechanism in
intellectual development.

* *One course or many?*

Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through 
the same set of stages. This assumption is explicit in the 
work of Gesell, who sees development as a more continuous process.

More recent ecological and dynamic systems theories posit that there
may be multiple ways to reach the same point. The path taken by a
given child will depend on the child's unique combination of personal
and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in
development.

```{r dynamic, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:dynamic)'}

```

how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point 
using different paths. Source: @BERK2013.

* *Nature or nurture?*

Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing
development? Theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but
differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question
how to explain individual differences.

Maturation is the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course
of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that
differences in development are innate and stable over time. Others
argue that such differences are primarily driven by environmental 
factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child
development.

The answer --- if there is one --- in this stability-versus-plasticity
discussion has important practical consequences. If we believe that
differences are natural and stable, then it does not make sense trying
to change the conditions, as the impact on development will be
negligible. On the other hand, if we believe that development is
plastic, then intervening by high-quality programmes may have a
substantial pay-off in terms of improved development.


## Example of motor development

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pkg <- c("knitr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
loaded <- sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE, 
                 warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = "?")
```

For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in
the classic study on child development among 25 babies by
@SHIRLEY1931. Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of
the baby's walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out
a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room,
and lightly greases the soles of the baby's feet with olive oil. The
baby was invited to "walk" on the sheet. Of course, very young infants
need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by
graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were
repeated every week or bi-weekly.

```{r shirley, echo = FALSE}
shirley <- data.frame(
  name = c("Martin", "Carol", "Max", "Virginia Ruth", "Sibyl",

  walk_help = c(21, 37, 25, 41, 37, 34, 45, 42, 41, 38,
  45, 45, 45, 49, 54, 46, 50, 45, 72, 54, 44),
  walk_alone = c(50, 50, 54, 54, 58, 60, 60, 62, 62, 64,
  66, 66, 66, 66, 68, 70, 70, 70, 74, 76, NA))
kable(shirley, 
      col.names = c("Name", "Sex", "Stepping", "Standing", 
                    "Walking with help", "Walking alone"))
```

: (\#tab:shirley) Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) 
for 21 babies [@SHIRLEY1931, Appendix 8].

Table \@tab:shirley lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when
they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and
walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark
in the first column the babies were already stepping when the
observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and
Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped
standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris
has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she
could walk alone.

```{r stepplot, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.6, fig.cap = '(ref:stepplot)'}
d <- shirley %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, as.character(name))) %>%
  gather(key = "stage", value = "age", -name, -sex) %>%
  mutate(
    stage = factor(stage, unique(stage)),
    score = rep(1:4, each = 21))
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_step() + 
  geom_point() +

  facet_wrap(~ name, nrow = 3) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Stage")
```

(ref:stepplot) Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby 
achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning.

Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) is a visual representation of the
information in Table \@ref(tab:shirley). Each data point is the age of
first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is
supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs,
there is a jump to the next level.

The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and
slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot 
children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry)
or who jump over stages (Martin, Max).

For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally
spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no
interpretation. In particular, the vertical distance does not tell us
how difficult it is to achieve the next stage. Instead, difficulty
corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction
between stages. For example, on average the line for `stepping` is
rather short in all plots, so going from `stepping` to `standing` is
relatively easy.

The figure presents information from only those visits where a jump
occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was
far higher. @SHIRLEY1931 actually collected data from 1370 visits,
whereas Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) plot just the 76 visits with jumps.
Thus, to obtain these individual curves the design has to be intense 
and costly.

## Age-based measurement of development {#agebased}

The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to
describe the behavior expected at a selected age. @GESELL1943 (p. 89)
formulates this goal as follows:

> We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms
> of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait
> which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age.

@STOTT1967 (p. 22) observed that it is impossible to define a scale
for measuring child development:

> When development appears as a change in kind, that is, when the 
> change consists of a series of qualitatively different events,
> or features, or "stages", it is not amemable to measurement
> by use of any standard scale of units.

As a solution Stott suggested using the "invariable sequence" of
successive stages as the basis for the assessment of the individual's
status. Stott argues that such sequences are fairly well established
for physical activity, but probably less so for the acquisition of
speech and other social skills.

Since age and development are so intimately related, the difficulty of
developmental a given milestone is traditionally expressed in terms of
the age at which children achieve the milestone. For example,
@STOTT1967 (p. 25) defines the *age equivalent* and its use for
measurement, as follows:

> The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age 
> at which children reach that particular stage. A set of age 
> equivalents corresponding to a series of stages can be made to 
> function as a scale for individual assessment.

Alternatives to the age equivalents include the ages at which 10, 50
or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of
reasoning has led to the widely used concept of `developmental age` as
a measure of a child's development (in body size or motor skill or
psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms.

Age-based measurement was once the dominant paradigm for measuring child
development. However, it comes with some major problems and limitations.

1. Age-based measurement does not tell us what is normal for a child
at a given age. We can properly infer whether a child is early or late
for a given milestone. However, this does not mean that we may reverse
the direction of the inference, or conclude which behaviors are
characteristic for a given age without making further assumptions.

2. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there
is no norms, we cannot calculate development. Age-based measurement
intertwines the actual PASS/FAIL score with age norms.

3. Age-based measurement only works at the item level, and is 
cumbersome to apply with multiple items,

## Score-based measurement of development

As an alternative we may administer multiple items to the child, and
and compute the total number of PASS responses as a measure of child's
development. Items are generally ordered in increasing difficulty.
Items that are too easy are skipped, and very difficult items are not
administered, so in practice the interpretation of the sum score is
slightly more complicated. Most instruments describe corrections that
should be applied, and present the scores relative to a norm group.
Instruments usually contain different sets of items, each of which
measures a specific domains of development, and the administration is
repeated for each domain of interest.

Score-based measurement is the currently dominant approach, but has 
both conceptual and logistical issues.

1. The total scores calculated by different instruments are based on
different sets of items, and hence cannot be compared. In addition,
instruments use their own age norms, which also affects comparability.

2. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive items tap
into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways
to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument.

3. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The
materials are proprietary, and may be costly in research settings.
