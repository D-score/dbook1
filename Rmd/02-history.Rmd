## What is child development? {#sec:definitions}

In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what
exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies
in the field [@shirley1931] was executed under the explicit aim 

> ... that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, 
> motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously.

Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these
domains of development.

```

Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure
\@ref(fig:shirleyplot) illustrates the various stages needed for going
from a *fetal posture* to *walking alone*. The ages are indicative
when these events happen, but there is a large variation in timing
between infants.

@gesell1943 (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development:

> Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in
> an orderly sequence. 

Gesell's definition emphasizes that development is a continuous
process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of
maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves.

@liebert1974 (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon
that unfolds in isolation.

> Development refers to a process in growth and capability over 
> time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with 
> the environment.

@cameron2012 (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows:

> "Growth" is defined as an increase in size, while "maturity" or 
> "development" is an increase in functional ability...The endpoint
> of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate 
> successfully ... not just biological maturity but also behavioral
> and perhaps social maturity.

@berk2013 (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on
child development as follows:

> Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, 
> and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions,
> each representing a different skill area that may undergo both
> continuous and stagewise transformation.

There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given
here just illustrate the main points of view in the field.

## Theories of child development {#sec:theories}

The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic
disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to
the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient
themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g.
@santrock2010, @berk2013), or by searching for the topic of interest
in an encyclopedia (e.g. @salkind2002).

The introductions by @santrock2010 and @berk2013 both distinguish
major theories in child development according to how each answers
to following three questions:

### Continuous or discontinuous?

Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process 
or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring 
from one stage to another?

Many stage-based theories of human development have
been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by
psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by
Erikson [@erikson1963], Kohlberg's six stages of moral development
[@kohlberg1984] and Piaget's cognitive development theory
[@piaget1969]. Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout
childhood. The first period, the *sensimotor period* (approximately
0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these
six stages describe "the road to conceptual thought". Piaget's stages
are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism in
intellectual development.

On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a 
continuous process. @gesell1943 (p. 88) says:

> A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle 
> of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while 
> development, like time, keeps marching on.

### One course or many?

Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through 
the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the 
work of Gesell.

The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as
continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion,
so there may be multiple ways to reach the same point. Figure
\@ref(fig:dynamic) illustrates that the path taken by a given child
will depend on the child's unique combination of personal and
environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in
development.

include_graphics("fig/dynamic.png")
```

### Nature or nurture?

Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing
development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but
differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question
how to explain individual differences.

Maturation usually defined as the genetically determined, naturally
unfolding course of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists
emphasize that differences in development are innate and stable over
time, but that there may be differences in speed. Others argue that
individual differences are primarily driven by environmental factors,
and changing these factors could very well impact child development.

The answer --- if there is one --- in this stability-versus-plasticity
debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that
differences are natural and stable, then it may not make sense trying
to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to
be small. On the other hand, if we view development as plastic, then
improving the environment may have substantial pay-offs in terms of
improved development.

## Example of motor development {#sec:motorexample}

### Shirley's motor data

For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in
the classic study on child development among 25 babies by
@shirley1931. Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of
the baby's walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out
a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room,
and lightly greases the soles of the baby's feet with olive oil. The
baby was invited to "walk" on the sheet. Of course, very young infants
need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by
graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were
repeated every week or bi-weekly.

```{r shirley, echo = FALSE}
load(file = file.path("data/shirley.rda"))
options(knitr.kable.NA = '?')
kable(shirley, 
      col.names = c("Name", "Sex", "Stepping", "Standing", 
                    "Walking with help", "Walking alone"))
```

: (\#tab:shirley) Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) for 21 babies [@shirley1931, Appendix 8].

Table \@ref(tab:shirley) lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies
when they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with
help, and walking alone, as taken from Table 3 in @vanbuuren1992.
Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark in the first
column the babies were already stepping when the observation started
(Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and Martin, who have a
question mark in the second column, skipped standing and went directly
from stepping to walking with help. Doris has a question mark in the
last column, because she died before she could walk alone.

### Individual trajectories of motor development

```{r stepplot, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.6, fig.cap = '(ref:stepplot)', warning = FALSE}
d <- shirley %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, as.character(name))) %>%
  gather(key = "stage", value = "age", -name, -sex) %>%
  mutate(
    stage = factor(stage, unique(stage)),
    score = rep(1:4, each = 21))
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_step() + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_light() + 
  facet_wrap(~ name, nrow = 3) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Stage")
```

(ref:stepplot) Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby 
achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning.

Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) is a visual representation of the
information in Table \@ref(tab:shirley). Each data point is the age of
first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is
supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs,
there is a jump to the next level.

The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and
slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot 
children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry)
or who jump over stages (Martin, Max).

For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally
spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no
sensible interpretation. We might be inclined to think that the
vertical distance portrays to how difficult it is to achieve the
next stage, but this is inaccurate. Instead, difficulty of passing from
one stage to the next corresponds to the *length of the line in the
horizontal direction* between stages. For example, on average the line
for `stepping` is rather short in all plots, so going from `stepping`
to `standing` is relatively easy.

The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred.
The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher.
@shirley1931 actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure
\@ref(fig:stepplot) plot only the 76 visits that showed a jump.
In order to obtain individual curves like these, the data collection 
needs to be intense and costly. Fortunately, there are alternatives that
are much more efficient.

## Typical questions asked in child development {#sec:questions}

Child development is very relevant for answering clinical, policy and
public health questions.

Table: (\#tab:question) Questions whose answers require quantitative measurements of child development.

```{r echo = FALSE}
questions <- data.frame(
  Level = c(rep("Individual", 3), rep("Group", 2), rep("Population", 3)),
  Question = c(
    "What is your gain in development since your last visit?",
    "What is the difference in development between you and your friend of the same age?",
    "How does your development compare to a norm?",
    "What is the effect of this intervention on child development?",
    "What is the difference in child development between these two groups?",
    "What is the change in average child development since the last measurement?",
    "What was the effect of implementing this policy on child development?",
    "How does this country compare to other countries in terms of child development?"
  ))

kable(questions)
```

Table \@ref(tab:question) lists typical questions whose answers
require measuring child development. Note that all questions compare
the amount of child development between groups and/or time points. A
few questions compare development for the same child, group or
population at different ages. Some others compare development within
the same age across different children, group or populations.
