## What is child development?

In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what
exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies
in the field [@SHIRLEY1931] was executed under the explicit aim 

> ... that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, 
> motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously.

Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these
domains of development.

```

Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure
\@ref(fig:shirley-motor) illustrates the various stages needed for
going from a *fetal posture* to *walking alone*. The ages are
indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in
timing between infants.

@GESELL1943 (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development:

> Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in
> an orderly sequence. Each stage represents a degree or level of
> maturity in the cycle of development. A stage is simply a passing
> moment, while development, like time, keeps marching on.

Gesell's definition emphasizes that development is a continuous
process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of
maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves.

@LIEBERT1974 (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon
that unfolds in isolation.

> Development refers to a process in growth and capability over 
> time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with 
> the environment.

@CAMERON2012 (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows:

> "Growth" is defined as an increase in size, while "maturity" or 
> "development" is an increase in functional ability...The endpoint
> of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate 
> successfully ... not just biological maturity but also behavioral
> and perhaps social maturity.

@BERK2013 (p. 30) presented the emerging dynamic systems perspective on
child development as follows:

> Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, 
> and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions,
> each representing a different skill area that may undergo both
> continuous and stagewise transformation.

There are many more definition of child development, but the ones
given here illustrate the wide variety of perspectives on child
development.

## Theories of child development

The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic
disciplines. This very short overview therefore cannot do justice to
the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient
themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g.
@SANTROCK2010, @BERK2013), or by searching for the topic of interest
in an encyclopedia (e.g. @SALKIND2002).

The introductions by @SANTROCK2010 and @BERK2013 are surprisingly
consistent in distinguishing major theories in child development
according to their answer to three questions:

* *Continuous or discontinuous?*

Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process (Gesell) 
or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jump occurring 
from one stage to next other?

Several influential stage-based theories of human development have
been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by
psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by
Erikson [@ERIKSON1963], Kohlberg's six stages of moral development
[@KOHLBERG1984] and Piaget's cognitive development theory
[@PIAGET1969]. Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout
childhood. The first period, the *sensimotor period* (approximately
0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these
six stages describe the road to conceptual thought. Piaget's stages
are qualitatively differentiated, and aim to unravel the mechanism in
intellectual development.

* *One course or many?*

Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through 
the same set of stages. This assumption is explicit in the 
work of Gesell, who sees development as a more continuous process.

More recent ecological and dynamic systems theories posit that there
may be multiple ways to reach the same point. The path taken by a
given child will depend on the child's unique combination of personal
and environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in
development.

```

how different combinations of skills may lead to the same end point 
using different paths. Source: @BERK2013.

* *Nature or nurture?*

Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing
development? Theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but tend
to differ in their emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the
question how to explain individual differences.

Maturation is the genetically determined, naturally unfolding course
of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists emphasize that
differences in development are innate and stable over time. Others
argue that such differences are primarily driven by environmental 
factors, and changing these factors could very well impact child
development.

The answer --- if there is one --- in the stability-versus-plasticity
discussion is very important. If you believe that differences are
natural and stable, then it does not make sense trying to change the
conditions, as the impact on development will be negligible. On the
other hand, if you believe that development is plastic, then
intervening by high-quality programmes may have a substantial pay-off
in terms of improved development.

The position of each theory with respect to these three questions
are rooted in different views of human

fundamental three questions are related.

## Numerical example

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pkg <- c("knitr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
loaded <- sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE, 
                 warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = "?")
```

For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in
the classic study on child development among 25 babies by
@SHIRLEY1931. Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of
the baby's walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out
a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room,
and lightly greases the soles of the baby's feet with olive oil. The
baby was invited to "walk" on the sheet. Of course, very young infants
need substantial assistence, and the footprints left were later
colored by graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year
were repeated every week or bi-weekly.

  66, 66, 66, 66, 68, 70, 70, 70, 74, 76, NA))

```

: (\#tab:shirley) Age at beginning stages of walking (in weeks) 
for 21 babies [@SHIRLEY1931, Appendix 8].

Table \@tab:shirley lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when
they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and
walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark
in the first column the babies were already stepping when the
observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and
Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped
standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris
has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she
could walk alone.

```{r stepplot, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.6, fig.cap = '(ref:stepplot)'}
d <- shirley %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, as.character(name))) %>%
  gather(key = "stage", value = "age", -name, -sex) %>%
  mutate(
    stage = factor(stage, unique(stage)),
    score = rep(1:4, each = 21))
ggplot(d, aes(age, stage, group = name, colour = name)) +
  geom_step() + 
  geom_point() +

  facet_wrap(~ name, nrow = 3) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Age (weeks)", y = "Stage")
```

(ref:stepplot) Staircase plot indicating the age at which each baby 
achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning.

Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) is a visual representation of the
information in Table \@ref(tab:shirley). Each data point is the age of
first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is
supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs,
there is a jump to the next level.

The figure makes it easy to spot the quick (Martin, Carol) and slow
(Patricia, Torey, Larry) walkers. Furthermore, it is easy to find
children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry)
and who jump over stages (Martin, Max).

The height of the jump has no interpretation. For ease of plotting,
the categories on the vertical axis are equally spaced, so the height
of the jump does not relate to the difficulty of the next stage.
Instead, the length of the line in the horizontal direction
corresponds to the the difficulty of going from one stage to the next.
For example, on average the line for `stepping` is relatively short in
all plots, so going from `stepping` to `standing` is easy.

The figure presents information from only those visits where a jump
occurred. The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was
far higher. @SHIRLEY1931 actually collected data from 1370 visits,
whereas Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) plot just the 76 visits with jumps.
Thus, the data collection effort has to surprisingly intense in order
to obtain these individual curves.

With current access to quick computation, it is possible (and better
use of the data) to utilize the information from all visits.

As a solution @STOTT1967 suggests using the "invariable sequence" of 
successive stages as the basis for the assessment of the individual's 
status. 
Stott argues that such sequences are fairly well established for 
physical activity, but less so for the acquisition of speech and 
other social skills, which makes their measurement harder.
