## What is child development?

In contrast to concepts like height or temperature, it is unclear what
exactly constites child development. One of the first rigorous studies
in the field [@SHIRLEY1931] was executed under the explicit aim 

> ... that the many aspects of development, anatomical, physical, 
> motor, intellectual, and emotional, be studied simultaneously.

Shirley gave empirical operationalizations of each of these
domains of development.

Certain domains advance through a fixed sequence. Figure
\@ref(fig:shirleyplot) illustrates the various stages needed for
going from a *fetal posture* to *walking alone*. The ages are
indicative when these events happen, but there is a large variation in
timing between infants.

@GESELL1943 (p. 88) formulated the following definition of development:

> Development is a continuous process that proceeds stage by stage in
> an orderly sequence. 

Gesell's definition emphasizes that development is a continuous
process. The stages are useful as indicators to infer the level of
maturity, but are of limited interest by themselves.

@LIEBERT1974 (p. 5) emphasized that development is not a phenomenon
that unfolds in isolation.

> Development refers to a process in growth and capability over 
> time, as a function of both maturation and interaction with 
> the environment.

@CAMERON2012 (p. 11) defined an end-point of development, as follows:

> "Growth" is defined as an increase in size, while "maturity" or 
> "development" is an increase in functional ability...The endpoint
> of maturity is when a human is functionally able to procreate 
> successfully ... not just biological maturity but also behavioral
> and perhaps social maturity.

@BERK2013 (p. 30) presented a dynamic systems perspective on
child development as follows:

> Development cannot be characterized as a single line of change, 
> and is more like a web of fibers branching out in many directions,
> each representing a different skill area that may undergo both
> continuous and stagewise transformation.

There are many more definitions of child development. The ones given
here just illustrate the main points of view in the field.

## Theories of child development

The field of child development is huge and spans multiple academic
disciplines. This short overview therefore cannot do justice to
the enormous richness. Readers new to the field might orient
themselves by browsing through an introductory academic title (e.g.
@SANTROCK2010, @BERK2013), or by searching for the topic of interest
in an encyclopedia (e.g. @SALKIND2002).

The introductions by @SANTROCK2010 and @BERK2013 both distinguish
major theories in child development according to how each answers
to following three questions:

* *Continuous or discontinuous?*

Does development evolve gradually as a continuous process 
or are there qualitatively distinct stages, with jumps occurring 
from one stage to another?

Many stage-based theories of human development have
been proposed over the years: social and emotional development by
psychosexual stages of development proposed by Freud and furthered by
Erikson [@ERIKSON1963], Kohlberg's six stages of moral development
[@KOHLBERG1984] and Piaget's cognitive development theory
[@PIAGET1969]. Piaget distinguishes four main periods throughout
childhood. The first period, the *sensimotor period* (approximately
0-2 years), is subdivided into six stages. When taken together these
six stages describe "the road to conceptual thought". Piaget's stages
are qualitatively different, and aim to unravel the mechanism in
intellectual development.

On the other hand, Gesell and others emphasize development as a 
continuous process. @GESELL1943 (p. 88) says:

> A stage represents a degree or level of maturity in the cycle 
> of development. A stage is simply a passing moment, while 
> development, like time, keeps marching on.


* *One course or many?*

Stage theorists assume that children progress sequentially through 
the same set of stages. This assumption is also explicit in the 
work of Gesell.

The ecological and dynamic systems theories view development as
continuous, though not necessarily progressing in an orderly fashion,
so there may be multiple ways to reach the same point. Figure
\@ref(fig:dynamic) illustrates that the path taken by a given child
will depend on the child's unique combination of personal and
environmental circumstances, including cultural diversity in
development.

knitr::include_graphics("fig/dynamic.png")
```

* *Nature or nurture?*

Are genetic or environmental factor more important for influencing
development? Most theories generally acknowledge the role of both, but
differ in emphasis. In practice, the debate centers on the question
how to explain individual differences.

Maturation usually defined as the genetically determined, naturally
unfolding course of growth, much like a flower. Some theorists
emphasize that differences in development are innate and stable over
time, but that there may be differences in speed. Others argue that
individual differences are primarily driven by environmental factors,
and changing these factors could very well impact child development.

The answer --- if there is one --- in this stability-versus-plasticity
debate has important practical consequences. If we believe that
differences are natural and stable, then it may not make sense trying
to change the environment, as the impact on development is likely to
be small. On the other hand, if we view development as plastic, then
improving the environment may have substantial pay-offs in terms of
improved development.

## Example of motor development

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pkg <- c("knitr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
loaded <- sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE, 
                 warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = "?")
```

For illustration, we use data on locomotor development collected in
the classic study on child development among 25 babies by
@SHIRLEY1931. Starting at ages around 13 weeks, a graphic record of
the baby's walking was obtained as follows. The investigator lays out
a white paper of twelve inches wide on the floor of the living room,
and lightly greases the soles of the baby's feet with olive oil. The
baby was invited to "walk" on the sheet. Of course, very young infants
need substantial assistence. Footprints left were later colored by
graphite and measured. Measurements during the first year were
repeated every week or bi-weekly.

for 21 babies [@SHIRLEY1931, Appendix 8].

Table \@ref(tab:shirley) lists the age (in weeks) of the 21 babies when
they started, respectively, stepping, standing, walking with help, and
walking alone. Question marks indicate missing data. A question mark
in the first column the babies were already stepping when the
observation started (Virginia Ruth, Sibyl, Donovan and Doris). Max and
Martin, who have a question mark in the second column, skipped
standing and went directly from stepping to walking with help. Doris
has a question mark in the last column, because she died before she
could walk alone.

achieve a new milestone of gross-motor functioning.

Figure \@ref(fig:stepplot) is a visual representation of the
information in Table \@ref(tab:shirley). Each data point is the age of
first occurence of the next stage. Before that age, the baby is
supposed to be in the previous stage, so once the next stage occurs,
there is a jump to the next level.

The figure makes it easy to spot the quick walkers (Martin, Carol) and
slow walkers (Patricia, Torey, Larry). Furthermore, we may also spot 
children who remain a long time in a particular stage (Torey, Larry)
or who jump over stages (Martin, Max).

For ease of plotting, the categories on the vertical axis are equally
spaced. The height of the jump from one stage to the next has no
interpretation. In particular, the vertical distance does not tell us
how difficult it is to achieve the next stage. Instead, difficulty
corresponds to the length of the line in the horizontal direction
between stages. For example, on average the line for `stepping` is
rather short in all plots, so going from `stepping` to `standing` is
relatively easy.

The figure presents data from only those visits where a jump occurred.
The number of house visits made during ages 0-2 years was far higher.
@SHIRLEY1931 actually collected data from 1370 visits, whereas Figure
\@ref(fig:stepplot) plot just the 76 visits with jumps. Thus, to
obtain these individual curves like these data collection needs to be
intense and costly.

## Typical questions asked in child development {#sec:questions}

Child development is very relevant for answering clinical, policy and
public health questions. On the level of the individual child, we pose questions like:

- What is your gain in development since your last visit? 

- What is the difference in development between you and your friend 
of the same age?

- How does your development compare to a norm?

The identification of determinants or effects of interventions typically
formulate questions at the group level. Some examples are:

- What is the effect of this intervention on child development?

- What is the difference in child development between these two groups?

Questions on the level of the population health levels include:

- What is the change in average child development since the last
measurement?

- What was the effect of implementing this policy on child development?

- How does this country compare to other countries in terms of child development?

Note that all questions compare the amount of child development between 
groups and/or time points. A few questions compare development for the same
child/group/population at different ages. Some others compare
development within the same age across different children, group 
or populations.


## Three ways to quantify child development {#sec:threeways}

This section distinguished three different methods to quantify child
development: age-based, score-based and unit-based measurement.

### Age-based measurement of development {#sec:agebased}

The motivation for measuring child development is to be able to
describe the behavior expected at a selected age. @GESELL1943 (p. 89)
formulates this goal as follows:

> We think of behavior in terms of age, and we think of age in terms
> of behavior. For any selected age it is possible to sketch a portrait
> which delineates the behavior characteristics typical of the age.

@STOTT1967 (p. 22) observed that it is impossible to define a scale
for measuring child development:

> When development appears as a change in kind, that is, when the 
> change consists of a series of qualitatively different events,
> or features, or "stages", it is not amemable to measurement
> by use of any standard scale of units.

As a solution Stott suggested using the "invariable sequence" of
successive stages as the basis for the assessment of the individual's
status. Stott argues that such sequences are fairly well established
for physical activity. He admits though that such stages are less
clear for the acquisition of speech and other social skills.

Since age and development are so intimately related, the *difficulty*
of developmental a given milestone is traditionally expressed in terms
of the age at which children achieve the milestone. For example,
@STOTT1967 (p. 25) defines the *age equivalent* and its use for
measurement, as follows:

> The age equivalent of a particular stage is simply the average age 
> at which children reach that particular stage. A set of age 
> equivalents corresponding to a series of stages can be made to 
> function as a scale for individual assessment.

Alternatives to the age equivalents include the ages at which 10, 50
or 90 percent of the children achieve the milestone. This line of
reasoning has led to the widely used concept of `developmental age` as
a measure of a child's development (in body size or motor skill or
psychological function) expressed in terms of age norms.

Age-based measurement was once the dominant paradigm for measuring
child development. It is easy to understand, but is not without 
some problems and limitations.

1. Age-based measurement does not tell us what is normal for a child
at a given age. We can properly infer whether a child is early or late
for a given milestone. However, this does not give us insight which
behaviors are characteristic at the child's age.

2. Age-based measurement cannot exists without an age norm. When there
is no norms, we cannot quantify development. Age-based measurement
does not separate quantification of development from evaluation of 
development.

3. Age-based measurement only works at the item level, and is 
cumbersome to apply with multiple items.

### Score-based measurement of development {#sec:scorebased}

A second approach to measurement is to administer multiple items to
the child, and and compute the total number of PASS responses as a
measure of child's development. Items can be ordered in difficulty, so
one may skip items that are too easy, and stop when items become too
difficult. Since different children get different sets of items, one
cannot simply interpret the sum score of a measure of development.
Most instruments describe corrections that should be applied,
typically under the assumption that the child would have passed all
"too easy" items and failed on all "too difficult" items. This
procedure is typically repeated for different domains, e.g. motor,
cognitive, and so on.

Score-based measurement is the dominant approach, but is not without
conceptual and logistical issues.

1. The total scores calculated by different instruments are based on
different sets of items, and hence cannot be compared. In addition,
instruments use their own age norms, but these do extend to norms for
measurements made by other instruments.

2. Domains are hard to separate. For example, some cognitive items tap
into fine motor capabilities, and vice versa. There are different ways
to define domains, so domain interpretation varies by instrument.

3. Administration of a full test may take substantial time. The
materials are often proprietary and sometimes costly.

### Unit-based measurement of development {#sec:unitbased}

Unit-based measurement starts from the premise that the measurement
scale must have a constant unit. If that holds, then the same
difference between two values has the same interpretation anywhere on
the scale. Familiar examples of such scales includes temperature and
dates. For example, the difference between two dates corresponds to
the same amount of time, irrespective of whether this is now, in the
past or in the future. The interval scale has a fixed unit and an
arbitrary zero.

In the ideal situation, we would have a unit for child development.
Let us name this unit *D*, for development. Unit *D* should have the
following desirable properties:

- Difference between two *D*-scores measured on the same child at
different ages quantifies the amount of development during the
interval

- Difference between the *D*-score measured on two different children
of the same age quantifies the difference in development between them

- Comparing the *D*-score to an age-dependent reference identifies
abnormal development

The interpretation of the difference between two *D*-score is the same
across the entire scale, just like differences in height or weight.
Note that the unit would allow us to answer all questions raised in section @\ref(sec:questions).

The development of a unit for development is still in its infancy.
However, if we succeed in creating an interval scale for development,
then an enormous arsenal of technique developed for quantitative
variables opens up to measure, track and analyze child development.

### Why we need unit-based measurement {#sec:whyunit}

This section reviewed age-based, score-based and unit-based approaches
to the measurement of child development. Age-based measurement
expresses development in age-equivalents, whose precise definition
depends on the reference population. Score-based measurement
quantifies development by summing the number of passes, but different
instruments make different selections of items, so the measurements
are unique to the instruments, and cannot be compared across
instruments. Neither approach provides a unit for child development.

In order to make progress, what we need is the definition of a unit for
child developent, and an operationalization how each measurement item
related to the unit. If we success in this, we are able to construct
different instruments that yields measurement in a common metric. The
next chapter will introduce the basic concepts for this new approach.
