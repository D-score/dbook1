# D-score: Turning milestones into measurement

Children learn to walk, speak, and think at an astonishing pace. The D-score captures this process as a one-number summary. The D-score booklets explain why we need the D-score, how we construct it, and how we calculate it. Application of the D-score enables comparisons in child development across populations, groups and individuals.

We are preparing four D-score booklets under the following titles:

1.	[D-score: Turning milestones into measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1)
2.	[D-score: Tuning instruments to unity](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook2)
3.	[D-score: Tailoring tests to fit the occasion](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook3)
4.	[D-score: Taking off the hood](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook4)

Editors: [Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name), [Iris Eekhout](https://www.iriseekhout.com)
