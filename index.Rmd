title: "D-score: Turning milestones into measurement"
author: "Editor: Stef van Buuren (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research TNO, Leiden)"
description: "The D-score is a one-number summary that quantifies generic development of children, closely modelled after body measurements like height and weight. This booklet is an accessible introduction to the D-score. The text illustrates the main concepts with real data collected on the Dutch Development Instrument for children aged 0-2 years."

# $D$-score booklets {-}

Children learn to walk, speak, and think at an astonishing pace. The $D$-score captures this process as a one-number summary. The $D$-score booklets explain why we need the D-score, how we construct it, and how we calculate it. Application of the D-score enables comparisons in child development across populations, groups and individuals.

We are preparing four $D$-score booklets under the following titles:

1.	[D-score: Turning milestones into measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1)
2.	[D-score: Tuning instruments to unity](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook2)
3.	[D-score: Tailoring tests to fit the occasion](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook3)
4.	[D-score: Taking off the hood](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook4)

Editors: [Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name), [Iris Eekhout](https://www.iriseekhout.com)

[Booklet 1](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1/) is currently available as a complete draft. The text of [Booklet 2]((https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook2/) is about 90 percent complete. Booklets 3 and 4 are in preparation. The series addresses conceptual aspects of the $D$-score, discusses practical issues, and introduces a dedicated set of `R` packages.

The *Health Birth Growth and Development knowledge integration (ki)* program of the *Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation* kindly supports the work.
