# Welcome {-}

The $D$-score is a one-number summary score that quantifies the
general development of children. Here you find introductory booklets
on the $D$-score, each of which addresses a particular aspect of the
$D$-score concept.

The $D$-score booklet series consists of the following titles:

1. [Turning milestones in measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/)
2. [Tuning instruments to unity](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook2/)
3. [Tailoring tests to fit the occasion](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook3/)

[Booklet I](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/) is currently
available as a complete draft. We plan to write booklets 2 and 3 in 2019 and
2020.

The *Health Birth Growth and Development knowledge integration (ki)* program of the *Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation* kindly supports the work.
