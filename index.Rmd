# Preface {-}

This is an introductory booklet on the measurement of child
development by means of the D-score. The D-score is a one-number
summary that quantifies generic neurocognitive development for
children with ages 0-4 years.

This is the *first* in a series of three booklets. The series consists
of the following titles:

1. [D-score for measuring development of children 0-4 years](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/)
2. [D-score for international comparisons](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook2/)
3. D-score for creating better instruments
