# Preface {-}

This is an introductory booklet on the measurement of child development 
by means of the D-score. The D-score is a one-number summary that 
quantifies generic neurocognitive development for 
children with ages 0-4 years.

This is the first in a series of three booklets. The series consists 
of the following titles:

1. D-score for measuring neurocognitive development 0-4 years (this booklet)
2. D-score for international comparisons
3. D-score for creating better instruments

The development of this series was kindly supported by the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
